When we review new integration tools, accessibility features are always an important consideration. Unfortunately, as integrations are created by third-party developers and offered to Canvas clients as an optional service, we cannot always ensure that these integrations meet the same standards that we hold for core Canvas. Therefore, if an institution wants to incorporate an integration where additional features may be required, we recommend the institution contact the developer directly with any specific concerns.\\nSome integrations are non-optional hosted services within Canvas. Any accessibility issues for Canvas-hosted services should be submitted as a help ticket via the institution's support process.

The hierarchy of dates include the following: Section dates can override course dates Course dates can override term dates Additionally, some overrides may leave the course open for participation. Term dates, course dates, and section dates can also be added through SIS imports. SIS enrollment CSV files that include start_date and end_date values override term dates, course dates, and section dates. In conjunction with this lesson, to see an example of how term dates, course dates, and section dates work together, view the Terms, Courses, and Section Enrollments resource document . Notes: End dates occur at precisely the minute they are set. For example, a course with an end time at 11:59pm will end at 11:59:00.  View Term Details In the Terms page , administrators can view term dates. Term dates define a fixed period of time for an institution where users can participate in a course. Term dates can also be used for semesters, trimesters, or quarters. In this example, the term runs from July 2, 2018, to December 23, 2018. Administrators have control over when specific users can participate in the courses. Unless otherwise specified, Students inherit the term start and term end date, while Teachers, TAs and Designers dates inherit a whenever start date to the term end date. Whenever means that these user roles can always access a course before the term begins. Note: Instructors and students cannot view the Terms page. However, instructors can view term dates in Course Settings . Admins should make sure instructors and students are aware of term dates for their institution publicly, such as through a course catalog, website posting, or other distribution method. Warning about End Term Dates Again, in the example about access dates, the ending dates would be as follows: Instructors (teachers)  can access courses until 12:00 am on December 31, 2018 (last full day is December 30). Everyone else with a term end date  can access courses until 12:00 am on December 23, 2018 (last full day is December 22). When a term has concluded, associated courses are placed in a read-only (archived) state. Read-only means that a course is not available for submitting assignments, posting discussions, uploading files, grading, or any other action-based task within a course. Note: Canvas currently does not generate a warning about term dates as it does for course dates. View Future Enrollments Once a user is added to a course, terms set default dates for when users have access to courses assigned to that term. Access relates to published courses. If a course is unpublished or does not include a link , students cannot have access to any course content until the start date of the term. If a course is published , students are able to view content before the start of the term. However, they cannot fully participate in the course, such as submitting an assignment or contributing to a discussion topic. On the start date of the term, students can fully participate in the course. Some institutions may choose to publish their courses on the same day as the term start date, so prior access to course content is not an issue. However, some prefer to allow instructors to publish their own courses ahead of the term start date and restrict student access to the course completely before the course begins. Students can also be restricted from being able to view a course after it has ended. View Course Dates Courses may be assigned to the Default Term or a specific term .

Create a text-based whiteboard that everyone in the classroom can see and refer to later. Assign student groups a collaborative assignment as a graded assignment (instructor feature). View Google Docs Collaborations All Canvas courses support Google Docs as the default collaborations tool. Collaborations that leverage Google Docs require that all participating students have created and linked their Google account to their personal Settings. Google Docs allows you to add up to 50 users per collaboration, and all users can view and edit a document at the same time.

Canvas provides an integrated system for class discussions, allowing both instructors and students to start and contribute to as many discussion topics as desired. Discussions allows for interactive communication between two or more people; users can participate in a conversation with an entire class or group. Discussions can also be created as an assignment for grading purposes (and seamlessly integrated with the Canvas Gradebook), or simply serve as a forum for topical and current events. Discussions can also be created within student groups. Discussion topics can be organized as focused or threaded discussions. Focused discussions only allow for two levels of nesting, the original post and subsequent replies. Threaded discussions allow for infinite levels of nesting. Focused discussions are relatively short-lived interactions, while threaded discussions allow replies within replies and may last for a longer period of time.  Focused Discussions Focused discussions are relatively short-lived interactions that tend to disappear as the course progresses, such as a weekly forum for questions related to that week's activities. Use a focused discussion for single posts and related comments. One discussion leader typically posts a message and multiple learners comment on it. Participants may leave a side comment to a reply, but cannot develop the conversation beyond two layers of nesting. Focused discussions might also be used to: Answer a single question. Share resources amongst peers. Collect results from a simple research activity. Share solutions to a single problem. Correct misconceptions. Clarify course policies. Get feedback on a work in progress. Share insights about a single reading. Threaded discussions Threaded discussions include infinite layers of response nesting, allowing commenters to continue responding on a single nested thread. Threaded discussions lend themselves to the refining of complex ideas. Responses and different lines of inquiry can be quickly navigated due to its hierarchical structure. Threaded discussions may be long-standing spaces for thoughts that persist throughout an entire course. Use a threaded discussion for multiple posts and related comments. One or more discussion leaders post a message and multiple learners comment on it with the freedom to create any number of related discussion topics and comments. Threaded Discussions might also be used to: Post and answer multiple related or unrelated questions. Organize results from a complex research activity. Share and iterate upon ideas shared by each student in the course. Debate the pros and cons of a single issue or multiple issues. Ask multiple questions of a single discussion leader. Refine ideas between multiple discussion leaders and multiple learners. Facilitate group discussions around multiple topics. Facilitate discussions around a discussion (fishbowl conversations). Explore at length the feasibility of different solutions to a complex problem. How do I use Discussions as an Instructor? Within Discussions you can: Create , edit, and delete discussion topics. You can also reply to, edit, and delete individual student discussion posts. Create threaded or focused discussions within your course. (Private discussions can be initiated within student groups, which are not viewable by others outside that group.) Create discussions with varied due dates for different sections within your course. Create a group discussion as an assignment. Create a graded discussion for everyone, individual students, course sections, or course groups. When a discussion is marked as a graded assignment, the Canvas SpeedGrader™ isolates each student’s comments from the thread and combines them into one easily readable view for grading.

', context=[\"Document Title: What are Discussions\\n\\nWhat are Discussions? Canvas provides an integrated system for class discussions, allowing both instructors and students to start and contribute to as many discussion topics as desired. Discussions allows for interactive communication between two or more people; users can participate in a conversation with an entire class or group. Discussions can also be created as an assignment for grading purposes (and seamlessly integrated with the Canvas Gradebook), or simply serve as a forum for topical and current events. Discussions can also be created within student groups. Discussion topics can be organized as focused or threaded discussions. Focused discussions only allow for two levels of nesting, the original post and subsequent replies. Threaded discussions allow for infinite levels of nesting. Focused discussions are relatively short-lived interactions, while threaded discussions allow replies within replies and may last for a longer period of time.  Focused Discussions Focused discussions are relatively short-lived interactions that tend to disappear as the course progresses, such as a weekly forum for questions related to that week's activities. Use a focused discussion for single posts and related comments. One discussion leader typically posts a message and multiple learners comment on it. Participants may leave a side comment to a reply, but cannot develop the conversation beyond two layers of nesting. Focused discussions might also be used to: Answer a single question. Share resources amongst peers. Collect results from a simple research activity. Share solutions to a single problem. Correct misconceptions. Clarify course policies. Get feedback on a work in progress. Share insights about a single reading. Threaded discussions Threaded discussions include infinite layers of response nesting, allowing commenters to continue responding on a single nested thread. Threaded discussions lend themselves to the refining of complex ideas. Responses and different lines of inquiry can be quickly navigated due to its hierarchical structure. Threaded discussions may be long-standing spaces for thoughts that persist throughout an entire course. Use a threaded discussion for multiple posts and related comments. One or more discussion leaders post a message and multiple learners comment on it with the freedom to create any number of related discussion topics and comments. Threaded Discussions might also be used to: Post and answer multiple related or unrelated questions. Organize results from a complex research activity. Share and iterate upon ideas shared by each student in the course. Debate the pros and cons of a single issue or multiple issues. Ask multiple questions of a single discussion leader. Refine ideas between multiple discussion leaders and multiple learners. Facilitate group discussions around multiple topics. Facilitate discussions around a discussion (fishbowl conversations). Explore at length the feasibility of different solutions to a complex problem. How do I use Discussions as an Instructor? Within Discussions you can: Create , edit, and delete discussion topics. You can also reply to, edit, and delete individual student discussion posts. Create threaded or focused discussions within your course. (Private discussions can be initiated within student groups, which are not viewable by others outside that group.) Create discussions with varied due dates for different sections within your course. Create a group discussion as an assignment. Create a graded discussion for everyone, individual students, course sections, or course groups. When a discussion is marked as a graded assignment, the Canvas SpeedGrader™ isolates each student’s comments from the thread and combines them into one easily readable view for grading.

LTI provides a framework through which an LMS (Canvas) can send some verifiable information about a user to a third party. By default, most user information is anonymized, but this can be changed when the configuration is first set up. External Apps can be configured on the account or course level.  How Standardization Enhances EdTech Integration Across LMS Platforms The EdTech ecosystem includes multiple learning management systems (LMSs) such as Canvas, D2L, Blackboard, Moodle, and others. Each LMS may use its own data model and terminology for organizing information. For example, a student’s ID field might be labeled as StudentID, LearnerID, or StudentIdentification, depending on the platform. When a tool integrates with multiple LMSs, these differences present a challenge. If each LMS has its own way of identifying information, the tool must create separate, customized integrations for each platform. This is a significant expense, both in initial development and ongoing maintenance. How LTI Streamlines EdTech Integration Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a set of standards that enables LMSs to share a common endpoint. This allows a single educational tool to be developed once and used across multiple platforms, eliminating the need for custom integrations. LTI enhances the EdTech ecosystem by making a wider array of tools available in all environments. The LTI specifications are developed and maintained by 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global). How LTI works LTI provides a framework that allows an LMS, such as Canvas, to send verifiable user information to a third-party tool. For LTI to function, the third party must provide a consumer key and shared secret, which Canvas uses to generate a signature verifying the authenticity of the transmitted data. By default, most user information is anonymized, but these settings can be adjusted during the initial configuration. When Would I Use An External App? External Apps add functionality to a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may want to include a study aid (flashcards, mini-quizzes, etc.) to help students better understand the concepts being taught. Admins can add external apps for accounts and subaccounts via XML, URL, or manual configuration. If apps do not already exist for a course, instructors can add external apps in their courses to create additional learning paths for students. External apps can be added to Modules, Course Navigation, the Rich Content Editor, and Assignments. In the Rich Content Editor, external apps can be accessed from the Apps icon or added to the toolbar for an account . How to Configure External Apps External apps using LTI can be configured at either the account level or the course level, providing flexibility in how tools are deployed within an institution. By standardizing integrations across LMS platforms, LTI streamlines the implementation of educational tools, reducing costs and increasing the availability of resources for educators and learners alike. When Would I Use The Canvas App Center? Admins and instructors can also enable apps through the App Center, which is integrated directly in Canvas. The Canvas App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. It allows you to: Add new features to Canvas at the account or course level Configure apps to link to modules or assessments Install apps without the help of IT Create a customized teaching experience Open the door to more possibilities Filter apps by name View installed apps The App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. Admins can manage the apps that can be used in courses for accounts and subaccounts by creating an allow list in the Edu App Center and managing the allow list in Canvas. What Does LTI Have to Do With Canvas? Canvas is considered an LTI platform. This means that tools can be launched from within Canvas. The places tools can be launched from are called Placements—some examples include the Rich Content Editor, assignments, and the left-hand navigation bar. When a tool is launched from one of these locations, it receives information about the context from which it was launched,', \"Document Title: What are External Apps LTI Tools\\n\\nthe Rich Content Editor, assignments, and the left-hand navigation bar. When a tool is launched from one of these locations, it receives information about the context from which it was launched, such as the placement location, the user who launched it, and the course it was launched from. The tool can then use this information to determine what the user should see and what actions they should be able to perform. A tool can send information back to Canvas through the Assignments and Grade Service (AGS) or Deep Linking. Both of these methods are described in more detail in the LTI documentation linked below. Data sent back through these methods is stored in Canvas databases as appropriate. The image below may help you visualize the connections between the different pieces. Account Vs Course Level Installs LTI tools can be installed at the account or course levels. The same features are generally available for both, though installations at the course level cannot use global placements. Account-level installations are available in all courses, whereas course-level installations are only available in the specified course. For LTI 1.3 tools, the developer key must be installed at the account level, but the actual installation can occur at the course, account, or subaccount level. Differences between LTI 1.1 And 1.3 LTI 1.1 was the original Learning Tools Interoperability specification. LTI 1.1 tools can be installed via EduAppCenter or by accessing Canvas and going to Settings > Apps > View App Configurations, then clicking + App and adding a tool manually, by URL, or by pasting XML. LTI 1.3 is a newer version of the specification that improves the security of the authentication process. It is also extensible, meaning that 1EdTech can add more features to it without breaking the existing specification. These features are called services or specifications. There is a required set for all platforms, including the Core Service, Names and Roles Provisioning Service, Assignments and Grade Service, and Deep Linking. Other services are optional and can be added depending on specific needs. In Canvas, LTI 1.3 requires an admin to set up a developer key in Settings, and then a user can add the tool at either the account or course level by pasting in the Client ID. Canvas' implementation of LTI 1.3 supports all placements from LTI 1.1, and our public documentation reflects LTI 1.3 as the standard moving forward. We are continuing to add support for new LTI 1.3 specifications.

For example, a student’s ID field might be labeled as StudentID, LearnerID, or StudentIdentification, depending on the platform. When a tool integrates with multiple LMSs, these differences present a challenge. If each LMS has its own way of identifying information, the tool must create separate, customized integrations for each platform. This is a significant expense, both in initial development and ongoing maintenance. How LTI Streamlines EdTech Integration Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a set of standards that enables LMSs to share a common endpoint. This allows a single educational tool to be developed once and used across multiple platforms, eliminating the need for custom integrations. LTI enhances the EdTech ecosystem by making a wider array of tools available in all environments. The LTI specifications are developed and maintained by 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global). How LTI works LTI provides a framework that allows an LMS, such as Canvas, to send verifiable user information to a third-party tool. For LTI to function, the third party must provide a consumer key and shared secret, which Canvas uses to generate a signature verifying the authenticity of the transmitted data. By default, most user information is anonymized, but these settings can be adjusted during the initial configuration. When Would I Use An External App? External Apps add functionality to a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may want to include a study aid (flashcards, mini-quizzes, etc.) to help students better understand the concepts being taught. Admins can add external apps for accounts and subaccounts via XML, URL, or manual configuration. If apps do not already exist for a course, instructors can add external apps in their courses to create additional learning paths for students. External apps can be added to Modules, Course Navigation, the Rich Content Editor, and Assignments. In the Rich Content Editor, external apps can be accessed from the Apps icon or added to the toolbar for an account . How to Configure External Apps External apps using LTI can be configured at either the account level or the course level, providing flexibility in how tools are deployed within an institution. By standardizing integrations across LMS platforms, LTI streamlines the implementation of educational tools, reducing costs and increasing the availability of resources for educators and learners alike. When Would I Use The Canvas App Center? Admins and instructors can also enable apps through the App Center, which is integrated directly in Canvas. The Canvas App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. It allows you to: Add new features to Canvas at the account or course level Configure apps to link to modules or assessments Install apps without the help of IT Create a customized teaching experience Open the door to more possibilities Filter apps by name View installed apps The App Center is part of the Apps tab in both Account and Course Settings. Admins can manage the apps that can be used in courses for accounts and subaccounts by creating an allow list in the Edu App Center and managing the allow list in Canvas. What Does LTI Have to Do With Canvas? Canvas is considered an LTI platform. This means that tools can be launched from within Canvas. The places tools can be launched from are called Placements—some examples include the Rich Content Editor, assignments, and the left-hand navigation bar. When a tool is launched from one of these locations, it receives information about the context from which it was launched,', \"Document Title: What are External Apps LTI Tools\\n\\nthe Rich Content Editor, assignments, and the left-hand navigation bar. When a tool is launched from one of these locations, it receives information about the context from which it was launched, such as the placement location, the user who launched it, and the course it was launched from. The tool can then use this information to determine what the user should see and what actions they should be able to perform. A tool can send information back to Canvas through the Assignments and Grade Service (AGS) or Deep Linking. Both of these methods are described in more detail in the LTI documentation linked below. Data sent back through these methods is stored in Canvas databases as appropriate. The image below may help you visualize the connections between the different pieces. Account Vs Course Level Installs LTI tools can be installed at the account or course levels. The same features are generally available for both, though installations at the course level cannot use global placements. Account-level installations are available in all courses, whereas course-level installations are only available in the specified course. For LTI 1.3 tools, the developer key must be installed at the account level, but the actual installation can occur at the course, account, or subaccount level. Differences between LTI 1.1 And 1.3 LTI 1.1 was the original Learning Tools Interoperability specification. LTI 1.1 tools can be installed via EduAppCenter or by accessing Canvas and going to Settings > Apps > View App Configurations, then clicking + App and adding a tool manually, by URL, or by pasting XML. LTI 1.3 is a newer version of the specification that improves the security of the authentication process. It is also extensible, meaning that 1EdTech can add more features to it without breaking the existing specification. These features are called services or specifications. There is a required set for all platforms, including the Core Service, Names and Roles Provisioning Service, Assignments and Grade Service, and Deep Linking. Other services are optional and can be added depending on specific needs. In Canvas, LTI 1.3 requires an admin to set up a developer key in Settings, and then a user can add the tool at either the account or course level by pasting in the Client ID. Canvas' implementation of LTI 1.3 supports all placements from LTI 1.1, and our public documentation reflects LTI 1.3 as the standard moving forward. We are continuing to add support for new LTI 1.3 specifications.

The data is available for reporting to support teaching improvement, identify at-risk students, and support the accreditation process. This unified, streamlined approach dramatically reduces the amount of work required to implement Learning Outcomes through the intelligent reuse of assessment workflows in the grading process. When would I use Outcomes? Use Outcomes to: Focus students' attention on the most important skills and activities in your course (find existing outcomes or create new ones) Align Quizzes and Assignments to different kinds of mastery Run reports at the account-level about student artifacts of learning mastery Assess student progress through calculation methods Track student progress on a learning outcome or overall in the Learning Mastery Gradebook Align accreditation or other core standards to programs of study, courses, or student assessments Calculation Methods When users create an outcome, users can set one of four calculation methods used for student mastery: Weighted Average, Decaying Average, n Number of Times, Most Recent Score, and Highest Score. Calculation methods are used in conjunction within the Learning Mastery Gradebook. Calculation methods can be set when creating custom course outcomes (instructors) or creating custom account outcomes (admins). Notes: For new Outcomes created in the Canvas interface, the default calculation is Weighted Average unless changed to another calculation. For new Outcomes created using the Outcomes API, the default calculation is set as Highest Score but can be modified with the appropriate parameters. If a user imports an outcome but does not have permission to modify the calculation method, the calculation method cannot be changed. Common Core outcomes are always calculated as Highest Score; however, the calculation method can be modified using the Outcomes API by any user with appropriate admin permissions. Weighted Average The Weighted Average calculation factors the average of all assessment items while weighing the most recent (current) submission to any assignment associated with this outcome at a higher percentage. By default, the Canvas weighted average is set at 65/35, meaning the current item is weighted at 65%, and the average of all other user scores is weighted at 35%. However, users can specify between 1% and 99% for the current percentage, and prior scores are weighted against the percentage difference. Note that the average is rounded to the next two decimals. If there is only one result, then the single score will be displayed. For example, a student has four aligned items with scores of 4, 3, 2, and 5 (scores listed chronologically from oldest to most recent). If the current item is set to be weighted at 65% of mastery, prior scores are weighted at 35%: Current item score: 5 Average of prior item scores: (4 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 3 Calculated score: 5 (.65) + 3 (.35) = 3.25 + 1.05 = 4.3 Decaying Average The Decaying Average calculation uses a formula to determine proficiency based on students' average scores, giving more weight to the most recent scored. To determine the weight given to the most recent score, the formula uses a decay rate. The higher the formula's decay rate, the more heavily the most recent assessment is weighted. By default, the decay weight is set at 65%. However, you can adjust the rate to any percentage between 50% and 99%. Between two assessments, the most recent assessment gets 65% weight and the first gets 35%. For each additional assessment, the sum of the\", 'Document Title: What are Outcomes\\n\\ncan adjust the rate to any percentage between 50% and 99%. Between two assessments, the most recent assessment gets 65% weight and the first gets 35%. For each additional assessment, the sum of the previous score calculations decay by an additional 35%. For example, a student has scores of 1, 2, 3, 4 (scores listed chronologically from oldest to most recent): (1 × .35) + (2 × .65) = X (X × .35) + (3 × .65) = Y (Y × .35) + (4 × .65) = Z\\xa0\\xa0(this being the current standard score; 3.48) n Number of Times The n Number of Times calculation requires a specific number of times that mastery must be met or exceeded, and the number of aligned items that must be completed for calculation eligibility. Any scores that do not meet mastery are not part of the calculation. Users can specify between 1 and 10 items required for mastery. For example, a student is required to achieve mastery 2 times with a mastery score of 5. If the student has scores of 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, and 6, only the scores of 5 and 6 would be part of the calculation. Average score of eligible items: 5 + 6 = 11 Calculated score: 11 / 2 = 5.5 Most Recent Score The Most Recent Score calculation always selects the most recent score for all assessment items. Highest Score The Highest Score calculation always selects the highest score for all assessment items. Select Average To select the average score from all assessment items, select the Average option . You can view an example of the Average calculation in the Example section . Note: Average is not a good fit for most outcomes-based or mastery-based learning use cases because students may need time to reach mastery of an outcome and early poorer performance can bring down an average.

Canvas has four different types of quizzes: A graded quiz is the most common quiz and rewards students points based on their quiz responses. A practice quiz is a learning tool to see how well users understand course material without providing a grade.

The SIS Imports feature allows you to upload and integrate data from various Student Information Systems (SIS), complex databases, and even simple spreadsheets as comma separated value (CSV) files. Admins can use this feature to create users, accounts, courses, enrollments, logins, and more. Only admins with the correct permissions can import and manage SIS data. For more information please see the Canvas Account Permissions resource document . View a video about SIS Imports .  When would I use SIS imports? With SIS imports, you can: Import SIS data with CSV files or automatically import via the Canvas API Import SIS data with IMS Enterprise Specification XML zip files Import SIS data with Banner Grade Exchange Results XML Create an automated data integration with Canvas Import Types The SIS Import page supports a few formats for standard imports to Canvas: Instructure formatted CSV or zipfile of CSVs, IMS Enterprise Specification XML zip, or Banner Grade Exchange Results XML. A standard import only processes changes that are specifically listed in the upload file and is an efficient way to upload a few records. For example, if a student enrollment was listed as active in a prior import but not present in the current enrollment, no change will take place to the student enrollment. The enrollment will remain active until marked as deleted or completed in a standard import (or is marked as not present in a Full Batch update for the term where the course is listed). During the beginning of a term, course enrollments change regularly; submitting a standard import frequently helps keep enrollments current in an account. When uploading SIS data with CSV files, you may import an individual CSV text file or you may compress multiple files into a single ZIP file to bulk import data. If you are using the Instructure format for importing files, the files should be in the following order: users, accounts, terms, courses, sections, enrollments, and logins. Full Batch Updates Canvas supports full batch updates for each import type. This option will only affect data that has been involved in a previous SIS job – either created by a previous import, or referenced by a SIS job after a SIS ID was manually added. Manually created courses with no SIS ID, for example, won\\'t be deleted even if they don\\'t appear in the new SIS import. For enrollments, this option means the linked user and course/sections require SIS IDs. A Canvas record will be deleted if it is not included in the current import file. This option can delete large data sets without any prompt or warning for confirmation and affects data created in previous SIS imports. Full batch updates are useful if: Your source SIS software doesn\\'t have a way to send delete records as part of an import, and you need to remove a fair portion of the imported data You want to be sure your current enrollment and data set are consistent with your SIS enrollment and course data Your SIS doesn\\'t track changes to course state or enrollments for students and/or teachers You want to delete courses that you have migrated to Canvas from another LMS Multi Term Batch Mode If you want to run a batch against all terms in the same import, you can enable multi term batch mode. This mode can only be enabled in the API and requires a change threshold as noted in the SIS Import Format Documentation . UI Overrides Canvas supports user interface (UI) overrides through SIS imports. When a user makes changes to certain data fields in Canvas (e.g., a user\\'s name), this change is \"sticky\" and is set as the new default. Selecting the Override UI option allows Canvas to overwrite any \"sticky\" data updated in the Canvas UI. Otherwise, attempting an import with conflicting data would be disregarded and the existing user data would not be changed. To view the full list of \"sticky\" data fields, see the SIS Imported Format Documentation .

When creating a calendar event as an instructor, if you want to create the same event multiple times for a course, you can create a duplicate event. Duplicating events creates multiple copies of the event every day, week, or month. For example, you may create a duplicate course event for student study groups every week. You will not grade students on whether or not they have participated in the study group, but you are providing a resource activity on a specific day to help them organize their time and prepare for your course more efficiently. Once created in a course calendar, duplicate events are not linked together and are independent events. Therefore, if users need to modify an event, each event has to be modified individually. Additionally, duplicate events can only be created when creating a new event; editing an existing event does not display the duplicate option. You can also create recurring calendar events . Tips for duplicate events: Weekly events are duplicated on the day of the week of the first event. For instance, if an event is created on a Monday and repeats weekly, the next instance of the event will appear on the following Monday, regardless of the actual date.\\u202c \\u202aMonthly events are duplicated on the day of the month of the first event.

The Card View Dashboard displays course cards for all your customized favorite or active courses. Course Cards can help you organize your courses by allowing you to add a nickname or customize the color, which is synced with the color shown for the course in the Calendar . The Card View Dashboard also includes the Dashboard sidebar , which includes items in your To-Do list and includes a link to the global Grades page. Favorited courses are removed from the Card View Dashboard when the courses are concluded. Concluded courses that were previously favorited are still shown as favorited in the Courses list . By default, active course cards are automatically added to your Dashboard. When you are enrolled in more than 20 courses, newer enrollments will replace older ones. This means the Dashboard prioritizes the 20 most recently added active courses, all listed in alphabetical order. Additionally, if you hold multiple roles in a course, the course with a higher-priority role will be listed. Note: Depending on your institution's preference,\\xa0the Card View may be your default Dashboard. If it is not, you can change your Dashboard view to Card View. Learn about changing the Dashboard view as a student , as an instructor , or as an observer/parent .  View Course Cards By default, the dashboard displays up to 20 course cards. These are prioritized based on the 20 recent courses you were added to, along with any courses you have marked as favorites. You can also choose to customize the course card display by adding or removing courses as favorite courses. Dashboard courses are ordered alphabetically by course name and your role in the course; nicknames and course codes do not apply to course ordering. Courses with instructor roles are listed first, followed by TA roles and student roles. If you are an instructor, course cards may be organized by published courses and unpublished courses. Note: If you customize the course list and manually select at least one course as a favorite, the Dashboard will only display favorite courses. Canvas will also continue to automatically favorite new published course enrollments. View Card Details Course cards show an overview of course information including the course name (or nickname), course code, and term . Each card can include up to four tabs , which represent the four main Canvas features for student course activity: Assignments, Announcements, Discussions, and Files. These tabs mimic visibility and order in Course Navigation, so for instance, if an instructor hides the Announcements link, the Announcements tab will not display on the course card. An unread icon on the Discussions or Announcements tab indicates that there is a new discussion or announcement in the course . The number in the icon indicates the number of new items. Create Nickname If a course has a long or confusing name, you can create a nickname for your course. Most courses are created using Student Information Systems (SIS) that generate course names based on terms, departments, and section numbers, and courses with similar names may be hard to distinguish. To add a nickname, click the Options icon , then enter the name in the Nickname field . Click the Apply button . To remove a nickname, open the card options and delete the nickname. The Nickname field will display the original name of the course. Then, click the Apply button.

The Card View Dashboard displays course cards for all your customized favorite or active courses. Course Cards can help you organize your courses by allowing you to add a nickname or customize the color, which is synced with the color shown for the course in the Calendar . The Card View Dashboard also includes the Dashboard sidebar , which includes items in your To-Do list and includes a link to the global Grades page. Favorited courses are removed from the Card View Dashboard when the courses are concluded. Concluded courses that were previously favorited are still shown as favorited in the Courses list . By default, active course cards are automatically added to your Dashboard. When you are enrolled in more than 20 courses, newer enrollments will replace older ones. This means the Dashboard prioritizes the 20 most recently added active courses, all listed in alphabetical order. Additionally, if you hold multiple roles in a course, the course with a higher-priority role will be listed. Note: Depending on your institution's preference,\\xa0the Card View may be your default Dashboard. If it is not, you can change your Dashboard view to Card View. Learn about changing the Dashboard view as a student , as an instructor , or as an observer/parent .  View Course Cards By default, the dashboard displays up to 20 course cards. These are prioritized based on the 20 recent courses you were added to, along with any courses you have marked as favorites. You can also choose to customize the course card display by adding or removing courses as favorite courses. Dashboard courses are ordered alphabetically by course name and your role in the course; nicknames and course codes do not apply to course ordering. Courses with instructor roles are listed first, followed by TA roles and student roles. If you are an instructor, course cards may be organized by published courses and unpublished courses. Note: If you customize the course list and manually select at least one course as a favorite, the Dashboard will only display favorite courses. Canvas will also continue to automatically favorite new published course enrollments. View Card Details Course cards show an overview of course information including the course name (or nickname), course code, and term . Each card can include up to four tabs , which represent the four main Canvas features for student course activity: Assignments, Announcements, Discussions, and Files. These tabs mimic visibility and order in Course Navigation, so for instance, if an instructor hides the Announcements link, the Announcements tab will not display on the course card. An unread icon on the Discussions or Announcements tab indicates that there is a new discussion or announcement in the course . The number in the icon indicates the number of new items. Create Nickname If a course has a long or confusing name, you can create a nickname for your course. Most courses are created using Student Information Systems (SIS) that generate course names based on terms, departments, and section numbers, and courses with similar names may be hard to distinguish. To add a nickname, click the Options icon , then enter the name in the Nickname field . Click the Apply button . To remove a nickname, open the card options and delete the nickname. The Nickname field will display the original name of the course. Then, click the Apply button.

Re-add your email address in Canvas. If you do not see the confirmation email, log in to Canvas, go to Account > Settings , and remove the unconfirmed email address. Then add it again to trigger a new confirmation email. Resend the confirmation manually. If the unconfirmed email still appears under your profile, click it to bring up the option to resend the confirmation email. Try resetting your password. Go to the Canvas login page, click Forgot Password , and enter your email. This can sometimes trigger a confirmation or reset email if your address is linked to an account. Contact Canvas Support or your IT team if none of the above works. The email may be on a bounce or suppression list, which Canvas Support can resolve, or it may be blocked by an email filter or firewall, which your IT team can address. If you're a Canvas admin, check the delivery status. You can verify whether the confirmation email was sent and whether it bounced using the following guides: How do I see which notifications have been sent to a user in an account?

CSV Separator Preferences You can set how you want to view separators in CSV export files, depending on your locale or preference. Separator settings are managed through one of three feature settings in User Settings. These settings only apply to compatible spreadsheet exports. Autodetect Field Separators in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports The Autodetect field separators feature settings attempts to determine the appropriate field separator as indicated by the language set in the user’s account. For languages where the decimal separator is a dot, (e.g. 1,234.56), autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator. For languages where the decimal separator is a comma, (e.g. 1.234,56), autodetection will choose a semicolon as the field separator. For all other cases, autodetection will choose a comma as the field separator as a default. Note: This feature is automatically disabled if the Use semicolons to separate fields setting is enabled. Include Byte-Order Mark in Compatible Spreadsheet Exports The Include Byte-Order Mark feature setting generates a specific set of three characters at the beginning of the CSV file. These characters, known as a byte-order mark, help some versions of Microsoft Excel understand that the CSV file is a UTF-8 encoded file. It also tells some localized versions of Excel that they should treat the incoming CSV file as if it were semicolon-separated by default. Because some versions of Excel do not understand or honor the byte-order mark, this feature allows all users to disable generation of this byte-order mark.

The Rich Content Editor includes an accessibility tool that detects common accessibility errors within the editor. You can use the Accessibility Checker to design course content while considering accessibility attributes. This tool only verifies content created within the Rich Content Editor. You may use other accessibility tools to verify additional content in Canvas. All accessibility components retain the parameters set by your institution's Theme Editor template. The Accessibility Checker verifies the following accessibility rules: Adjacent links: Adjacent links with the same URL should be a single link. This rule verifies link errors where the link text may include spaces and break the link into multiple links. Heading paragraphs: Headings should not contain more than 120 characters. Image alt text: Images should include an alt attribute describing the image content. Image alt filename: Image filenames should not be used as the alt attribute describing the image content. Currently, files uploaded directly to Canvas create a redirect that does not properly verify image filenames. Image alt length: Alt attribute text is recommended to contain fewer than 120 characters. Large text contrast: Text larger than 18pt (or bold 14pt) should display a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1. Lists: Lists should be formatted as lists. Sequential headings: Heading levels should not be skipped (e.g. H2 to H4). However, the tool does not check if the first header starts with H2 or whether the headings are sequential with the rest of the content in the page. Tables do not begin with H1, which is designated for the page title. Small text contrast: Text smaller than 18pt (or bold 14pt) should display a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. Table captions: Tables should include a caption describing the contents of the table. Table header scope: Table headers should specify scope and the appropriate structure. Table header: Tables should include at least one header.  View Accessibility Checker Notifications If any accessibility issues are detected within the Rich Content Editor, the Accessibility Checker displays an indicator . To view accessibility issues, click the Accessibility Checker icon . View Issues When an issue is detected, the Rich Content Editor highlights the affected area .

View Additional Issues If the Rich Content Editor contains more than one issue , you can view all issues by clicking the Previous or Next buttons . Apply Fix To correct an issue, complete the task as noted in the sidebar . For instance, if the issue requires that alt text be added to an image, the sidebar displays a text field for you to enter alt text. When you are finished with your changes, click the Apply button .

The Rich Content Editor includes an accessibility tool that detects common accessibility errors within the editor. You can use the Accessibility Checker to design course content while considering accessibility attributes. This tool only verifies content created within the Rich Content Editor. You may use other accessibility tools to verify additional content in Canvas. All accessibility components retain the parameters set by your institution's Theme Editor template. The Accessibility Checker verifies the following accessibility rules: Adjacent links: Adjacent links with the same URL should be a single link. This rule verifies link errors where the link text may include spaces and break the link into multiple links. Heading paragraphs: Headings should not contain more than 120 characters. Image alt text: Images should include an alt attribute describing the image content. Image alt filename: Image filenames should not be used as the alt attribute describing the image content. Currently, files uploaded directly to Canvas create a redirect that does not properly verify image filenames. Image alt length: Alt attribute text is recommended to contain fewer than 120 characters. Large text contrast: Text larger than 18pt (or bold 14pt) should display a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1. Lists: Lists should be formatted as lists. Sequential headings: Heading levels should not be skipped (e.g. H2 to H4). However, the tool does not check if the first header starts with H2 or whether the headings are sequential with the rest of the content in the page. Tables do not begin with H1, which is designated for the page title. Small text contrast: Text smaller than 18pt (or bold 14pt) should display a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. Table captions: Tables should include a caption describing the contents of the table. Table header scope: Table headers should specify scope and the appropriate structure. Table header: Tables should include at least one header.  View Accessibility Checker Notifications If any accessibility issues are detected within the Rich Content Editor, the Accessibility Checker displays an indicator . To view accessibility issues, click the Accessibility Checker icon . View Issues When an issue is detected, the Rich Content Editor highlights the affected area . The sidebar displays the accessibility attribute  and an explanation of the error . To learn more about the accessibility attribute, click the Information icon . View Additional Issues If the Rich Content Editor contains more than one issue , you can view all issues by clicking the Previous or Next buttons . Apply Fix To correct an issue, complete the task as noted in the sidebar . For instance, if the issue requires that alt text be added to an image, the sidebar displays a text field for you to enter alt text. When you are finished with your changes, click the Apply button . The Accessibility Checker will apply the fix and display information for the next issue. Continue to review and fix any detected issues within the editor. Confirm Fix When all issues have been fixed, or if no issues are detected in the Rich Content Editor, the sidebar indicates that no issues exist and will close automatically.\"], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata={'evolutions': ['Concretizing', 'Concretizing'], 'synthetic_input_quality': 1.0, 'context_quality': None}, comments=None, tools_called=None, expected_tools=None, source_file=None, name=None, custom_column_key_values=None),\n",
