Canvas DocViewer is a tool that allows annotations on uploaded online assignment submissions in Canvas. In assignment details, you can use DocViewer to view annotated feedback from your instructor or from other students in peer review assignments. You can also use DocViewer when submitting peer review feedback . Session Limits DocViewer has a 10-hour session limit that begins when you open a submission. If you start to make an annotation but do not submit it before the session expires, the annotation will not be saved. Canvas will display a session expiration warning at 9 hours 50 minutes, followed by a 5-minute and 1-minute warning until the 10-hour limit has been reached. You can restart a DocViewer session at any time by refreshing the submission page. If your browser includes a built-in PDF viewer, select the option to view the PDF in the system viewer. Compatible DocViewer Files If a submission includes a file that can be rendered in DocViewer, but the submission preview is not yet complete, Canvas will generate a message stating the document is still processing. Accessibility You can access DocViewer annotations and comments with a screen reader, which can read the annotation, author name, comments, and any reply comments at the end of the document. However, the following limitations currently exist: when you are listening to your document, there is no indication that a comment is available; if you are tabbing through comments, you cannot jump to the associated place in the annotated assignment; the kind of annotation is not indicated; some images may have no alternate text or display; markers in the document are not in-line with the text. Notes: If you cannot annotate a document in DocViewer, your institution may have restricted this feature. Files over 100 MB and password-protected files will not be converted by DocViewer. DocViewer annotations can be viewed in the Canvas Student app. Your instructor can delete any comment or annotation at any time. If your instructor anonymously grades an assignment, annotations in DocViewer will not be available until the assignment is unmuted. Submitted annotations are saved and are not affected by the session limit.  Review Feedback To access DocViewer, view feedback from your instructor or peer review feedback on the assignment details page. The Review Feedback displays an indicator if annotated comments have been added to a supported assignment. View DocViewer Toolbar The DocViewer Toolbar helps you manage the assignment submission. To download a PDF of the annotated submission, click the Download button . If there are multiple pages, the Page number field  will let you advance through the submission to find the page you want to annotate. To go to another page, enter the page number in the Page field.

This section heading only displays if there are discussions within this section. Pinned Discussions : These are discussions that your instructor wants you to pay specific attention to and appear at the top of the Discussions page. This section heading only displays if there are discussions within this section as designated by your instructor. Closed for Comments : These discussions have been manually closed for comments, or the discussion is past the available from/until date. These are discussions that are only available in a read-only state and are ordered by most recent activity. This section section heading displays even if there are no discussions within this section. View Individual Discussion Each discussion displays whether or not it is a graded discussion , the name of the discussion , the date on which the last discussion reply was posted , the due date (if any) , the number of unread/total posts in the discussion , and whether or not you are subscribed to the discussion . You can also view availability dates for individual discussions . An unread icon next to a discussion indicates an unread discussion . The number of unread/total posts will not appear for group discussions and discussions that have no discussion replies . There will also be a peer review icon if a graded\\xa0discussion has been assigned peer reviews . View Availability Dates The first dates you may see are the availability dates. Your instructor may use availability dates to restrict discussion replies to a specified date range. The availability dates are the range of time that the discussion is accessible to you. Availability dates also appear on the Assignments page for all discussions with assigned availability dates. If the discussion does not have a date listed, the discussion is open; you can reply to the discussion at any time during your course . If the discussion says Not Available Until [date], the discussion is locked until the specified date . If the discussion says Available until [date], you can reply to the discussion until the specified date . If the discussion is in the Closed for Comments section, the discussion cannot accept submissions . Discussions in this section may show a \"Was locked at [date]\" to indicate when the discussion was closed for comments . Note: If the listed date is set to 12 a.m. the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 p.m. View Due Dates The second set of dates are the due dates for each respective discussion . However, due dates only apply to graded discussions . Any replies to discussions after the due date are marked as late; some instructors may deduct points for late replies. You can still reply to late discussion before the Available until date. Due dates also include a time . If your instructor does not set a due time, the listed date displays the course\\'s default due time. Note: The Due date may be before or on the Available date.

View Grade Percentage In the analytics page, you can view your total grade percentage in the course. View Analytics Graphs By default, analytics are shown in a graph format. These are four types of graphs: Activity by Date, Communication, Submissions, and Grades. View Activity by Date The Activity by Date graph shows all your course activity. The x-axis represents the course dates, while the y-axis represents the number of page views. Dark blue bars represent participation in the course. If a date only includes page views, the bar only displays as light blue. The graph changes the bar display according to the length of time. Activity that is less than six months old displays bars as daily activity, at six months bars are displayed as weekly activity, and at approximately a year bars are displayed as monthly activity. To view the details of the bar graph, hover over the specific bar you want to view. The weekly view shows the first and last date for the week; the monthly view shows the month and the year. Browser window size, zoom level, and screen resolution may also change how the bars display. The following user actions will generate analytics course participation: Collaborations: loads a collaboration to view/edit the document Conferences: joins a web conference Discussions/Announcements: posts a new comment to a discussion or an announcement Quizzes: submits a quiz Quizzes: starts taking a quiz Assignments: submits an assignment Pages: creates a wiki page View Communication The Communication graph shows the conversations that have taken place with your instructor(s) through the Canvas Inbox. The x-axis represents the user type; orange message icons show when you sent a message to an instructor, and blue message icons show when an instructor sent a message to you. The y-axis represents the interaction date. To view the details of the bar graph, hover over the specific bar you want to view. You can view the date of the communication and how many messages were sent. A message is an individual message passed from one user to the other; in message threads, each message is individually counted. In group conversations, interactions are counted as long as you were one of the recipients. Notifications are not included in analytics unless you acted on the notification and generated a new message that passes through the Canvas Inbox. Announcements are not included in communication analytics. View Submissions The Submissions graph shows the status of each of your assignment submissions. The x-axis represents each assignment, while the y-axis represents the submission date. A green circle indicates an assignment that was submitted on time. A yellow triangle indicates an assignment that was submitted late. A red square indicates an assignment that is missing (not submitted). The diamond indicates the due date and the bar extends to the submission date. A white circle with a black outline indicates an assignment with a future due date. If a submission includes a due date, the submission may include horizontal line. The line indicates when the assignment was submitted, while the shape indicates the actual due date. If a submission was submitted before the due date, the horizontal line is green; if it was submitted after the due date, the horizontal line is yellow.

Future assignments include the assignment title, due date (if any), and the score. Note : The Submissions chart does not include information about assignments that do not require a submission (e.g., not graded, on paper assignments) or excused assignments. View Grades The Grades graph shows the median, high, and low scores for each of your assignments. The x-axis represents each assignment, while the y-axis represents the number of points for an assignment. The vertical black line extends from the highest score to the lowest score . The gray box extends from the 75th percentile to 25th percentile . The horizontal black line shows the median score for the assignment . Each assignment score is indicated by the same shapes found in the Submissions graph. A green circle indicates an assignment with a score at or above the course median. A yellow triangle indicates an assignment with a score slightly below the median. A red square indicates an assignment with a score below the median or at the bottom of the score range.

Quizzes are ordered by due date. Some quizzes may not include a due date. View Availability Dates The first dates you may see are called availability dates. Sometimes your instructor only wants you to submit a quiz during a specified date range, so the available dates are the range of time that the quiz is accessible to you. If the quiz does not have a date listed, the quiz is open; you can complete the quiz at any time during your course.

If a quiz does not include an Available until date, the quiz will autosubmit on the last day of the course. Note: If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date.
