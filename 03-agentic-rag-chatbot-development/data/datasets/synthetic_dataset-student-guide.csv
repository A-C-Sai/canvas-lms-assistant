How do I use DocViewer in Canvas assignments as a student?
Canvas DocViewer is a tool that allows annotations on uploaded online assignment submissions in Canvas. You can use DocViewer to
view annotated feedback
in the assignment details section of the sidebar from your instructor or from other students in peer review assignments.
DocViewer has a 10-hour session limit that begins when you open a submission. If you start to make an annotation but do not submit it before the session expires, the annotation will not be saved. Submitted annotations are saved and are not affected by the session limit. Canvas will display a session expiration warning at 9 hours 50 minutes, followed by a 5-minute and 1-minute warning until the 10-hour limit has been reached. You can restart a DocViewer session at any time by refreshing the submission page.
If your browser includes a built-in PDF viewer, select the option to view the PDF in the system viewer.
Compatible DocViewer Files
If a submission includes a file that can be rendered in DocViewer, but the submission preview is not yet complete, Canvas will generate a message stating the document is still processing.
Accessibility
You can access DocViewer annotations and comments with a screen reader, which can read the annotation, author name, comments, and any reply comments at the end of the document. However, the following limitations currently exist: when you are listening to your document, there is no indication that a comment is available; if you are tabbing through comments, you cannot jump to the associated place in the annotated assignment; the kind of annotation is not indicated; some images may have no alternate text or display; markers in the document are not in-line with the text.

Open Assignments
In Course Navigation, click the

In the Assignments Index page, you can view all the assignments in your course.
By default, assignments are grouped by overdue assignments, upcoming assignments, undated assignments, and past assignments.
Overdue Assignments
[1]: assignments and discussions that are past the due date, are still available, have not been submitted, and have not been graded.
Upcoming Assignments
[2]: assignments, discussions, and quizzes that have an upcoming due date.
Undated Assignments
[3]: assignments, discussions, and quizzes that do not have a due date.
Past Assignments
[4]: assignments and discussions that are past the due date and either are not available, have been submitted, or have received a grade; quizzes that are past the due date.
Each assignment also includes an icon with the assignment type: assignment [5], discussion [6], or quiz [7].

View Assignment Summary
Each assignment displays the assignment name [1], availability dates (if any) [2], due date (if any) [3], and points possible [4].
View Availability Dates
The first dates you may see are called availability dates. Sometimes your instructor only wants you to submit an assignment during a specified date range, so the available dates are the range of time that the assignment is accessible to you.
If the assignment does not have a date listed [1], the assignment is open; you can submit the assignment at any time during your course.
If the assignment says
Available until
[date] [2], you can submit the assignment until the specified date.
If the assignment says
Not Available Until
[date] [3], the assignment is locked until the specified date.
If the assignment says
Closed
[4], the assignment cannot accept submissions.
Note:
If the listed date is set to 12 am the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 pm.
View Due Dates
An assignment may display a second date, which is the
Due date
[1]. Any assignments submitted after the due date are marked as late; some instructors may deduct points for late submissions. Again, not all assignments may include a Due date.
Due dates also include a time [2]. If your instructor does not set a due time, the listed date displays the course's default due time.
You can still submit late assignments before the
Available until
date [3].
Please be aware that the Due date may be
before or on
the Available date.
Filter Assignments
If your course includes Multiple Grading Periods, you can view assignments by grading period [1]. You can search for an assignment by typing an assignment title or a keyword in the

View Assignment with Availability Dates
When you access an assignment during its set availability dates, you can view all available assignment information. Availability dates may include a first available date (open date), last available date (locked or closed), or both dates to create an overall date range. The Due date may be
before or on
the last available date (if one is set).
If you were to miss the assignment submission due date [1], you could still submit the assignment until the last available date [2]. Once the last available date passes, you can no longer submit the assignment.
View Assignment with Limited Attempts
Your instructor may limit the number of submission attempts you are allotted for an assignment. If your assignment has a limited number of submissions, you can view your submission attempts [1] and the number of allowed submissions for the assignment [2].

How do I use DocViewer in Canvas using Assignment Enhancements as a student? Canvas DocViewer is a tool that allows annotations on uploaded online assignment submissions in Canvas. In assignment details, you can use DocViewer to view annotated feedback from your instructor or from other students in peer review assignments. You can also use DocViewer when submitting peer review feedback . Session Limits DocViewer has a 10-hour session limit that begins when you open a submission. If you start to make an annotation but do not submit it before the session expires, the annotation will not be saved. Canvas will display a session expiration warning at 9 hours 50 minutes, followed by a 5-minute and 1-minute warning until the 10-hour limit has been reached. You can restart a DocViewer session at any time by refreshing the submission page. If your browser includes a built-in PDF viewer, select the option to view the PDF in the system viewer. Compatible DocViewer Files If a submission includes a file that can be rendered in DocViewer, but the submission preview is not yet complete, Canvas will generate a message stating the document is still processing. Accessibility You can access DocViewer annotations and comments with a screen reader, which can read the annotation, author name, comments, and any reply comments at the end of the document. However, the following limitations currently exist: when you are listening to your document, there is no indication that a comment is available; if you are tabbing through comments, you cannot jump to the associated place in the annotated assignment; the kind of annotation is not indicated; some images may have no alternate text or display; markers in the document are not in-line with the text. Notes: If you cannot annotate a document in DocViewer, your institution may have restricted this feature. Files over 100 MB and password-protected files will not be converted by DocViewer. DocViewer annotations can be viewed in the Canvas Student app. Your instructor can delete any comment or annotation at any time.
