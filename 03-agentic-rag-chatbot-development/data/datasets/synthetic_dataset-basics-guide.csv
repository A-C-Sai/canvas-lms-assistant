Browser Privacy Settings|Document Title: What are the browser and computer requirements for Instructure

Browser Privacy Settings
To ensure browser security, follow all browser security policies established by your institution, especially if you are using Instructure products on a computer provided by your institution.
When displaying content, Instructure products default to the preference set by a specific browser. Some browsers may occasionally make modifications to privacy settings to protect users from possible insecure content. Insecure content is identified with the prefix http:// in the URL and can create mixed content in your product page. Secured content is identified with the https:// prefix in the URL. For the best user experience, content should be secure to avoid browser conflicts.
If you are a Canvas admin, insecure content may be caused by hosting an insecure JS/CSS file outside of Canvas. If custom uploads are supported for your account, you can host your file in the Canvas Theme Editor, which will resolve any browser conflicts.
If you are a Canvas instructor who
embeds Canvas lessons
inside your course, you can prevent browser issues with mixed content using secured Canvas Guides URLs.
Known Browser Behaviors

In browsers such as Safari, insecure content never displays in the browser. However, in Chrome and Firefox, you may be able to view insecure content. Please be aware of possible restrictions and view insecure content with caution.
Chrome Security
Google Chrome verifies that the website content you view is transmitted securely. If you visit a page in your Instructure product that is linked to insecure content, Chrome displays a
Not Secure
security symbol in the browser address bar [1].
To select any needed permissions for a page, you can override security restrictions by clicking the Not Secure symbol and then clicking the

Allow
button [2].
Firefox Security

Browser Privacy Settings|Document Title: What are the browser and computer requirements for Instructure

Browser Privacy Settings
To ensure browser security, follow all browser security policies established by your institution, especially if you are using Instructure products on a computer provided by your institution.
When displaying content, Instructure products default to the preference set by a specific browser. Some browsers may occasionally make modifications to privacy settings to protect users from possible insecure content. Insecure content is identified with the prefix http:// in the URL and can create mixed content in your product page. Secured content is identified with the https:// prefix in the URL. For the best user experience, content should be secure to avoid browser conflicts.
If you are a Canvas admin, insecure content may be caused by hosting an insecure JS/CSS file outside of Canvas. If custom uploads are supported for your account, you can host your file in the Canvas Theme Editor, which will resolve any browser conflicts.
If you are a Canvas instructor who
embeds Canvas lessons
inside your course, you can prevent browser issues with mixed content using secured Canvas Guides URLs.
Known Browser Behaviors
Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari use HTML5 to display website content, promoting a faster, more secure browsing experience. For best performance in Instructure products, content should be designed to support HTML5.
In browsers such as Safari, insecure content never displays in the browser. However, in Chrome and Firefox, you may be able to view insecure content. Please be aware of possible restrictions and view insecure content with caution.
Chrome Security
Google Chrome verifies that the website content you view is transmitted securely. If you visit a page in your Instructure product that is linked to insecure content, Chrome displays a
Not Secure
security symbol in the browser address bar [1].
To select any needed permissions for a page, you can override security restrictions by clicking the Not Secure symbol and then clicking the
Site settings
link [2].
You can
learn more about Chrome security
.
Chrome Media Permissions
Chrome has its own media permission within the browser. To use your computer camera and microphone within any Instructure product feature, allow access to Instructure products via Chrome's media permission settings. This prompt appears just below the address bar [1]. To allow access, click the
Allow
button [2].
Firefox Security
Firefox
verifies that the website content you view is transmitted securely. If you visit a page in your Instructure product that is linked to insecure content, Firefox displays a crossed-out lock icon in the browser address bar [1].
To enable any needed permissions for a page, you can override security restrictions by clicking the crossed-out lock icon, clicking the
Connection not secure
option [2], clicking the
More Information
link, and selecting the
Permissions
tab.

"Are there any optional Canvas features, such as BigBlueButton conferences or LTI tools, that don’t work on Android tablets using Chrome in landscape mode?",,"• BigBlueButton conferences  
  – Students can join on Android tablets via the mobile-friendly HTML5 client.  
  – Host features such as screen-sharing still require the Java plugin (desktop only), so screen-share and some moderator controls are unsupported in Chrome on tablets.  

• LTI (third-party) tools  
  – Support varies by partner. Some tools function well in mobile browsers; others may have limited or no functionality on Android tablets.  
  – Any issues you encounter are reported back to the partner, but full mobile support isn’t guaranteed.","Document Title: What are the limited support guidelines for mobile browsers on

What are the limited-support guidelines for mobile browsers on tablet devices?
Canvas supports the latest two versions of the most
popular desktop browsers for Canvas
. Many users also rely on mobile devices. Native Canvas apps support a limited set of features on mobile, but the apps don't cover all Canvas functionality.
Canvas engineering teams do not fully support mobile browsers for Canvas but will ensure that critical features and functions work for tablet devices (screen sizes 7.9"" or higher used in landscape mode) running the most recent version of Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android).
What is Limited Browser Support?
Canvas engineering will reactively address critical issues with core features that affect the most recent version of the native browser on iOS and Android tablet devices in landscape mode.
Key Terms
Native browsers: Safari (iOS) and Chrome (Android)
Reactive: Quality assurance teams test against each fully-supported browser before every Canvas release. For mobile browsers, Canvas responds to problems reported by Canvas users.
Critical issue: An issue that makes an important feature or function unusable.
Core feature: A feature needed for a key teaching and learning interaction.
Most recent version: If theres a more recent version of the mobile browser and updating solves the problem, that solution will be suggested as the solution.
Tablet devices: Devices with 7.9"" or larger screens.
Landscape mode: The device is held so the display is wider than its height.
How quickly will qualifying mobile-browser issues be fixed?
Canvas treats qualifying mobile browser issues as bugs. Engineering teams triage these bugs by severity and resolve them on the following schedule:
Severity
Description
Resolution Time
Level 1
Users can’t access Canvas
Resources will be assigned immediately and will work uninterrupted until the problem is solved.
Level 2
Users can’t use a core feature; no workaround exists
Resources will be assigned within two hours and will work uninterrupted until the problem is solved.
Level 3
Users can’t use a core feature, but a workaround exists
Resources will be assigned within two business days and will develop and deploy a fix within two full release cycles.
Level 4
All other issues affecting only mobile browsers
Resources will review the problem within five business days, assessing impact, resource availability, and development priorities.
A given problem may not be fixed when the impact is minor, when the affected workflow is seldom used, or when a workaround exists.
Caveats—
Screen size and orientation
The Canvas web application is not fully responsive yet. Engineers are basing all
new
development on responsive-design best practices. This initiative will take some time to touch all parts of Canvas. In the meantime, Canvas will generally work better when viewed on a larger screen. Canvas teams may not choose to address issues that affect only devices with smaller screens or that affect larger-screen devices only when in portrait mode, even if they meet other criteria described above.
Big Blue Button conferencing
Screen-sharing in Canvas Conferences currently requires the Java plugin for desktop browsers. However, Big Blue Button (whose software powers Canvas Conferences) has created a mobile-friendly HTML5 version of their application for participants (primarily students). Other adjustments for additional user roles and features may be announced in future releases.
Partners and third-party tools
Many customers use third-party tools in Canvas, including LTI apps. Partner networks are encouraged to build tools that work well in mobile browsers, and any reported problems will be reported back to them. Some third-party tools will work better than others on mobile, and some may not work at all.",

1. Assign engineering resources within two hours of your report

"Can you explain what Canvas 508 VPAT is, how to use screen reader and ARIA navigation, what keyboard shortcuts are available in Canvas, how to add alt text and closed captions in the Rich Content Editor, and what the UDOIT LTI tool does?",,"Here’s a concise overview:

1. Canvas 508 VPAT  
   • What it is: A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template documenting how Canvas meets Section 508 and WCAG standards.  
   • How to use it: Administrators download the Canvas VPAT to review conformity and guide procurement or compliance decisions.

2. Screen readers & ARIA navigation  
   • Supported combos:  
     – Windows: JAWS or NVDA with Chrome/Firefox  
     – Mac/iOS: VoiceOver with Safari/Chrome  
     – Android: TalkBack with Chrome  
   • ARIA landmarks: Canvas markup uses ARIA regions for navigation—main nav, context nav, breadcrumbs, main region, complementary info, and content. Use your screen reader’s landmark or region commands (e.g., “next region”) and heading navigation within regions.

3. Keyboard shortcuts  
   • Rich Content Editor, discussions, announcements:  
     – PC: Alt + F8  
     – Mac: Option + F8  
   • Index pages (Assignments, Modules), Gradebook, SpeedGrader, New Quizzes:  
     – Shift + ?  
   • For JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver–specific tips, see the Canvas Keyboard Shortcut resource.

4. Adding alt text & closed captions in the Rich Content Editor  
   • Alt text for images: Insert or edit an image in the RCE, open image properties, and enter descriptive alt text.  
   • Closed captions for videos: Embed or upload a video in the RCE, open the captions panel, and upload or link a caption file (VTT).

5. UDOIT LTI tool  
   • Purpose: Scans your Canvas course for common accessibility issues (missing alt text, poor color contrast, etc.).  
   • How it works: Launch UDOIT from Course Tools, run a scan, review the generated report, and follow its suggestions to fix issues.","Document Title: What are the Canvas accessibility standards

What are the Canvas accessibility standards?
Ensuring an accessible and pleasant experience to all users, regardless of disability, is a key element of Canvas software. The Canvas platform was built using the most modern HTML and CSS technologies, and is committed to W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative and
Section 508
guidelines.
The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT, is a tool that administrators and decision-makers can use to evaluate Canvas' conformance with the accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. View more information about the
Canvas Voluntary Product Accessibility Template
.
General accessibility design guidelines can be found in the
General Accessibility Design Guidelines
document.
You can read more about the most recent accessibility and feature enhancements in the
Canvas Product Release Notes
. If you have additional suggestions, please contact
accessibility@instructure.com
.
Screen Readers and Browsers
Each Canvas feature and release is manually tested with the following screen reader and browser combinations:
JAWS
(latest version for Chrome/Firefox on Windows)
NVDA
(latest version for Chrome/Firefox on Windows)
VoiceOver
(latest version for Safari/Chrome on Macintosh and iOS mobile)
Talkback
(latest version for Android mobile)
Browser and screen reader pairing is selected based on current screen reader and browser usage statistics, ensuring that preferred combinations are always maintained for the widest range of Canvas users. As preferences shift and stabilize over time, Canvas testing and support shift to match them.
Canvas is designed so that screen reader users can confidently utilize their preferred screen reader and browser. However, the variety of browser and screen reader combinations means that only the above-listed combinations are tested and confirmed to work well in Canvas. If you experience issues using your preferred browser and screen reader combination, please review and utilize the officially supported combinations listed above. If you experience issues with the officially supported screen reader and browser combinations, please report your experience to Canvas Support.

Canvas makes extensive use of ARIA landmark regions. Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. Therefore, the best way to get around in Canvas is to navigate via regions. Within regions, Canvas uses HTML headings, so navigating between headings can be helpful.
When using a screen reader, the
Canvas page navigation menu
is as follows:
1. Main navigation
2. Context navigation
3. Breadcrumbs navigation
4. Main region
5. Complimentary information
6. Content information
Canvas Accessibility Components
Canvas contains several unifying accessibility features that can be found on various pages in Canvas.

Third-party (LTI) Integration Accessibility
Canvas offers many optional LTI app integrations as part of our commitment to open education. When we review new integration tools, accessibility features are always an important consideration. Unfortunately, as integrations are created by third-party developers and offered to Canvas clients as an optional service, we cannot always ensure that these integrations meet the same standards that we hold for core Canvas. Therefore, if an institution wants to incorporate an integration where additional features may be required, we recommend the institution contact the developer directly with any specific concerns.
Some integrations are non-optional hosted services within Canvas. Any accessibility issues for Canvas-hosted services should be submitted as a help ticket via the institution's support process. We are open to suggestions for new integrations and have an area in the
Instructure Community
forums for feature requests.

Additional Accessibility Resources
Universal Design Online content Inspection Tool (UDOIT):
(pronounced, You Do It) enables faculty to identify accessibility issues in their Canvas course content. It will scan a course, generate a report, and provide resources on how to address common accessibility issues. It was created by the
Center for Distributed Learning
(CDL) at the
University of Central Florida
(UCF).

"How do accessibility landmarks (ARIA regions), supported screen reader and browser combinations, the Move To menu, and keyboard shortcuts help me navigate Canvas?",,"1. Navigate by ARIA landmark regions  
   • Canvas pages are divided into six ARIA regions (Main navigation, Context navigation, Breadcrumbs, Main region, Complementary information, Content information).  
   • In your screen reader (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack), use the landmark-or region-navigation commands (for example, “D” in NVDA or rotor items in VoiceOver) to jump directly to each area without tabbing through every element.

2. Use a tested screen reader + browser combination  
   • JAWS or NVDA with Chrome/Firefox on Windows  
   • VoiceOver with Safari or Chrome on macOS/iOS  
   • TalkBack on Android  
   These pairings are manually tested and confirmed to work reliably in Canvas. If you use one of these combinations, you’ll avoid untested behavior.

3. Reorder content with the Move-To menu  
   • Wherever drag-and-drop exists (Course Navigation, Modules, Assignments, Discussions, Outcomes, Quizzes/New Quizzes), focus the item, activate the Move-To option, and select the target position by keyboard or screen reader.  
   • This ensures everyone can rearrange content without a mouse.

4. Speed through Canvas with keyboard shortcuts  
   • In the Rich Content Editor, announcements, or discussions: press Alt + F8 (Windows) or Option + F8 (Mac) to view shortcuts.  
   • On the Assignments Index, Modules Index, Gradebook, or SpeedGrader: press Shift + ? to open the shortcut list.  
   • Use these page-specific shortcuts to jump between tools, open menus, and perform actions without leaving the keyboard.","Document Title: What are the Canvas accessibility standards

What are the Canvas accessibility standards?
Ensuring an accessible and pleasant experience to all users, regardless of disability, is a key element of Canvas software. The Canvas platform was built using the most modern HTML and CSS technologies, and is committed to W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative and
Section 508
guidelines.
The Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT, is a tool that administrators and decision-makers can use to evaluate Canvas' conformance with the accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. View more information about the
Canvas Voluntary Product Accessibility Template

General accessibility design guidelines can be found in the
General Accessibility Design Guidelines

You can read more about the most recent accessibility and feature enhancements in the
Canvas Product Release Notes

Screen Readers and Browsers
Each Canvas feature and release is manually tested with the following screen reader and browser combinations:
JAWS
(latest version for Chrome/Firefox on Windows)
NVDA
(latest version for Chrome/Firefox on Windows)
VoiceOver
(latest version for Safari/Chrome on Macintosh and iOS mobile)
Talkback
(latest version for Android mobile)
Browser and screen reader pairing is selected based on current screen reader and browser usage statistics, ensuring that preferred combinations are always maintained for the widest range of Canvas users. As preferences shift and stabilize over time, Canvas testing and support shift to match them.
Canvas is designed so that screen reader users can confidently utilize their preferred screen reader and browser. However, the variety of browser and screen reader combinations means that only the above-listed combinations are tested and confirmed to work well in Canvas. If you experience issues using your preferred browser and screen reader combination, please review and utilize the officially supported combinations listed above. If you experience issues with the officially supported screen reader and browser combinations, please report your experience to Canvas Support.

What is the Teacher role?
In Canvas, the Teacher role is used to enroll users responsible for course creation, instruction, and management. Teachers are also referred to as instructors in Canvas. In general, users with the Teacher role have permissions that allow them to moderate a course, view course data, and direct daily course communications. However, these permissions may vary among institutions.
Other course-level user roles with varying course-level access exist in Canvas.
Designers
may work with Teachers (who oversee
Teacher Assistants
) and together they create course content with which
Students
and
Observers
engage. For more information about course-level user permissions, view the
Canvas Course Permissions PDF
.
Teachers (instructors) may also use the Canvas Teacher app to view some course content including announcements, assignments, discussions, and quizzes.
Teacher Role Use
Teachers (instructors) may create course materials, view course data, and access and manage all areas of a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may be added to a course with the Teacher role to lead a course.
The main uses of the Teacher role are to allow a user to:
Create and modify course content
Moderate and submit grades
Manually invite others to the course
Communicate with course participants
Access course analytics and student data
Monitor and moderate the participation and interactions of all enrolled users in a course
When a user manually creates a course, Canvas automatically enrolls that user as a Teacher in the course. A teacher may also be enrolled in a course manually by an administrator or automatically by SIS import.
Teacher Access in Canvas
By default, instructors with the Teacher role may access all areas of a Canvas course. However, these permissions may vary among institutions. To learn more about Teacher participation in Canvas, visit the Canvas Instructor Guide.
A Teacher can:
Add and delete external applications (LTI) for a course
Add, edit, and delete assignments, quizzes, course files and pages, and all other course content

How can I add teaching assistants to my Canvas course or give them institution-wide access using SIS imports or manual methods?,,"Here are two ways to enroll Teacher Assistants (TAs) in Canvas—either in individual courses or institution-wide—using manual or SIS import methods:

1. Manual Enrollment in a Course  
   1.1. In the desired course, go to People > + People.  
   1.2. Enter the TA’s email address or Canvas ID.  
   1.3. From the Role dropdown, choose Teacher Assistant.  
   1.4. Click Next, verify the details, then click Add to enroll.

2. Manual Account-Level (Institution-Wide) Enrollment  
   2.1. As an admin, go to your Root Account (Account > People) and click + People.  
   2.2. Enter the user’s email or Canvas ID.  
   2.3. Select Teacher Assistant as the role and ensure “All Courses” (or appropriate sub-account) is selected.  
   2.4. Click Next, review, then click Add.

3. SIS Import for Course-Level Enrollment  
   3.1. Create a CSV with headers:  
       • course_id  
       • user_id (or login_id)  
       • role  
       Fill role with TeacherEnrollment and, if required by your SIS mapping, a sub_role of assistant.  
   3.2. In Canvas, go to Admin > SIS Imports, upload your CSV, and run the import.  
   3.3. Verify in the course’s People page that TAs are listed.

4. SIS Import for Account-Level (Institution-Wide) Access  
   4.1. Prepare a CSV with headers:  
       • account_id  
       • user_id (or login_id)  
       • role (set to Teacher Assistant)  
   4.2. Upload it via Admin > SIS Imports.  
   4.3. Confirm the user appears under Account > People with the Teacher Assistant role—this grants access to all courses in that account.

Notes  
• TAs may also be auto-enrolled via your institution’s SIS if configured.  
• Permissions vary by institution; contact your Canvas admin to adjust TA permissions or availability.  
• For full file formats and additional options, see the Canvas SIS Import documentation.","Document Title: What is the Teacher Assistant role

"How do section overrides, course start and end dates, and SIS start and end dates work together to override the term dates and limit when students can access the course in Canvas?",,"Here’s how Canvas determines when students can access a course, from broadest to most specific:

1. Term Dates (Default)  
   • Students inherit the term start and end date.  
   • Instructors/TAs/Designers get “Whenever” start through term end.  

2. Course Participation Dates (Override Term)  
   • Set in Course Settings > Participation.  
   • A later start date delays when the course appears in the Dashboard and list.  
   • An earlier end date makes the course read-only for students outside those dates.  

3. Section Override Dates (Override Course & Term)  
   • Enabled when you set both a section start/end and check “Student Participation.”  
   • Students in that section follow these dates instead of the course’s.  

4. SIS Enrollment Dates (Top-Level Override)  
   • If your SIS CSV includes start_date/end_date, those dates override term, course, and section dates for that enrollment.  

Final Access Window  
   • Canvas uses the latest start date among term, course, section, and SIS.  
   • Canvas uses the earliest end date among term, course, section, and SIS.  
   • Outside that window, students can only view (or cannot access) the course.","Document Title: How do term dates course dates and section dates work in Canvas

How do term dates, course dates, and section dates work in Canvas? Term dates, course dates, and section dates are very symbiotic. All of them flow together in all aspects of Canvas.

Term dates, course dates, and section dates can also be added through SIS imports. SIS enrollment CSV files that include start_date and end_date values override term dates, course dates, and section dates. In conjunction with this lesson, to see an example of how term dates, course dates, and section dates work together, view the Terms, Courses, and Section Enrollments resource document . Notes: End dates occur at precisely the minute they are set. For example, a course with an end time at 11:59pm will end at 11:59:00.  View Term Details In the Terms page , administrators can view term dates. Term dates define a fixed period of time for an institution where users can participate in a course. Term dates can also be used for semesters, trimesters, or quarters. In this example, the term runs from July 2, 2018, to December 23, 2018. Administrators have control over when specific users can participate in the courses. Unless otherwise specified, Students inherit the term start and term end date, while Teachers, TAs and Designers dates inherit a whenever start date to the term end date. Whenever means that these user roles can always access a course before the term begins. Note: Instructors and students cannot view the Terms page. However, instructors can view term dates in Course Settings . Admins should make sure instructors and students are aware of term dates for their institution publicly, such as through a course catalog, website posting, or other distribution method. Warning about End Term Dates Again, in the example about access dates, the ending dates would be as follows: Instructors (teachers)  can access courses until 12:00 am on December 31, 2018 (last full day is December 30). Everyone else with a term end date  can access courses until 12:00 am on December 23, 2018 (last full day is December 22). When a term has concluded, associated courses are placed in a read-only (archived) state. Read-only means that a course is not available for submitting assignments, posting discussions, uploading files, grading, or any other action-based task within a course. Note: Canvas currently does not generate a warning about term dates as it does for course dates. View Future Enrollments Once a user is added to a course, terms set default dates for when users have access to courses assigned to that term. Access relates to published courses. If a course is unpublished or does not include a link , students cannot have access to any course content until the start date of the term. If a course is published , students are able to view content before the start of the term. However, they cannot fully participate in the course, such as submitting an assignment or contributing to a discussion topic. On the start date of the term, students can fully participate in the course. Some institutions may choose to publish their courses on the same day as the term start date, so prior access to course content is not an issue. However, some prefer to allow instructors to publish their own courses ahead of the term start date and restrict student access to the course completely before the course begins. Students can also be restricted from being able to view a course after it has ended. View Course Dates Courses may be assigned to the Default Term or a specific term . By default, course dates default to the term dates . However, course dates can be set to override the term dates or compliment the term dates. Both admins and instructors can manage these dates.

For example, if the term dates were August 31 to December 20, the instructor could set access to the course a week later and end the course a week earlier. By shortening the course participation start and end dates, students will only have read-only access to the course before and after those dates. The instructor can still manage course content and grades before the term end date set for instructors. Admins and instructors can also change student access settings to allow or restrict students from viewing the course before the start or end date .

View Section Dates The Section dates are the most mobile. Sections can be moved from term to term or course to course. If section enrollments need to be moved, such as for cross-listing a section into another course, section enrollments should be moved before students submit any coursework, as course participation cannot be transferred across sections. Section dates default to the course dates, unless you also set up section override dates. Override dates are only created if the Student Participation checkbox is selected as part of creating section start and end dates (both dates are required). Sections can have various start and end dates. For example, Section 2 could be set with a start date of September 26, 2018, and an end date of December 14, 2018.

"Why is the Lucid (Whiteboard) navigation link hidden in Canvas? Could it be due to institutional enablement, Canvas region hosting, age verification status, or account connection?",,"Possible reasons the Lucid (Whiteboard) link is hidden—and how to fix each:

1. Institutional Enablement  
  • Canvas admin must enable Lucid for your account.  
  • If you’re an instructor, ask your Canvas admin to turn on Lucid in your institution’s LTI tools.  

2. Canvas Region Hosting  
  • Lucid isn’t enabled for non-US regions by default.  
  • Have your Canvas admin contact Canvas Support to enable Lucid for your region.  

3. Age Verification  
  • First-time users must verify they’re over 13 (or get school permission if under 13).  
  • In Canvas, click any Lucid link (e.g., in Rich Content Editor), confirm role and age, then proceed.  

4. Lucid-Canvas Account Connection  
  • You must connect your Lucid account to Canvas before the link appears.  
  • Access Lucid (Whiteboard) via Course Navigation or by embedding a Lucid document—then click Connect, log in or sign up, and grant access.  
  • Refresh the Canvas page; the Lucid link should now display.  

5. Course Navigation Settings  
  • In your course, go to Settings > Navigation.  
  • If Lucid (Whiteboard) is in the hidden list, drag it to the visible list and click Save.

What is the Calendar?
One of the challenges facing both students and instructors is keeping track of all of the assignments planned throughout the term. Instructors are teaching multiple courses and students are learning in multiple courses. Every course has its own timeline for when things need to be done. The Calendar helps everyone stay on schedule and up to date.
The Calendar in Canvas is a global feature, meaning users can see all courses assignments and events in one place. Calendars can be filtered by selecting or deselecting courses in the sidebar.
To help manage user calendars, courses customized in the courses drop-down menu as a favorite course will always be listed at the top of the user’s calendar list in the calendar sidebar. By default, the Calendar displays a maximum of 10 course calendars. To increase the amount of course calendars that can display to users in your Canvas account, contact your Customer Success Manager.
Instructor View
The Calendar is used for reminding students of graded Assignments with specific due dates. To provide students with detailed descriptions of how synchronous class time will be used, consider using Pages or customizing the Course Home Page.
The Calendar automatically syncs with other features in Canvas, such as Assignments, Syllabus, and Grades, so if you create, change, or delete the due date of an Assignment on the Calendar, it will show up in all the others and vice versa. You can change dates easily by dragging and dropping assignments from one date to another.
When would I use the Calendar as an instructor?
As an instructor, use the Calendar to:
View and create activities in your course as well as events and personal reminders; you can also filter the calendar view to only see specific calendars.
Quickly add Assignments to a blank course. Fill in the details of those Assignments later.
Adjust the dates of Assignments that have been imported from previous terms. Canvas makes it easy to drag and drop events across multiple months.
Copy the iCal feed for all of your courses and import it to your preferred personal Calendar, such as Google or Outlook.

   - Contact your Canvas Customer Success Manager and request raising the maximum number of visible course calendars.","Document Title: What is the Calendar

What is the Calendar?
One of the challenges facing both students and instructors is keeping track of all of the assignments planned throughout the term. Instructors are teaching multiple courses and students are learning in multiple courses. Every course has its own timeline for when things need to be done. The Calendar helps everyone stay on schedule and up to date.
The Calendar in Canvas is a global feature, meaning users can see all courses assignments and events in one place. Calendars can be filtered by selecting or deselecting courses in the sidebar.
To help manage user calendars, courses customized in the courses drop-down menu as a favorite course will always be listed at the top of the user’s calendar list in the calendar sidebar. By default, the Calendar displays a maximum of 10 course calendars. To increase the amount of course calendars that can display to users in your Canvas account, contact your Customer Success Manager.
Instructor View
The Calendar is used for reminding students of graded Assignments with specific due dates. To provide students with detailed descriptions of how synchronous class time will be used, consider using Pages or customizing the Course Home Page.
The Calendar automatically syncs with other features in Canvas, such as Assignments, Syllabus, and Grades, so if you create, change, or delete the due date of an Assignment on the Calendar, it will show up in all the others and vice versa. You can change dates easily by dragging and dropping assignments from one date to another.
When would I use the Calendar as an instructor?
As an instructor, use the Calendar to:
View and create activities in your course as well as events and personal reminders; you can also filter the calendar view to only see specific calendars.
Quickly add Assignments to a blank course. Fill in the details of those Assignments later.
Adjust the dates of Assignments that have been imported from previous terms. Canvas makes it easy to drag and drop events across multiple months.

Assignments will remain in their assignment groups if an entire assignment group or all assignments are imported. SCORM content is included in course copies. SCORM content should only be copied within accounts that use the same key and secret configuration.

images associated with the stimulus question do not automatically import and need to be selected for import at the same time. Import Limitations The following behaviors also apply to Canvas copies or imports: Group sets do not copy as part of the import. Any existing group sets in the new course will be linked to the group set with the same name. However, if there are no group sets with the same name in the new course, the assignment will be linked to a new Project Groups set. Importing specific content from a Canvas course export package does not retain images and linked files in the content, such as in an assignment, page, or discussion. When selecting individual assignments, assignments are placed in an assignment group called Imported Assignments. However, assignments can be moved into other assignment groups as necessary. Enrollment-related data, which includes course users, collaborations, conferences, groups, and sections, and feature option settings are not included in course content imports. Announcements and Discussions do not retain the name of the user who originally created the course content. Additionally, students do not receive announcement notifications for imported announcements. However, a badge indicating a new announcement displays on the Card View and Recent Activity Dashboards. Assignments with a manual grade posting policy and anonymous assignments retain the manual grade posting policy and their anonymous settings as part of the course import. Calendar item locations (e.g., office hours slots with an assigned office location) are not included in course imports. Note: To prevent 0s (zero grades) from being automatically entered into the Gradebook when importing content into a course with a late/missing policy set up, it is recommended that you temporarily disable your late/missing policy before importing the content. You can re-enable it once the import is complete. Adjust Events and Due Dates In addition to recreating the structure and content of the course, the Course Import Tool can adjust events and due dates to the new date ranges of the new term. View Content Import Warning Message When importing content, a message displays explaining that previously imported content from the same course will be replaced while manually added content will remain. View Current and Prior Imports The Content imports section displays the status of your import, as well as any prior import history. Running reports display a progress bar . If you chose to select specific content in your course, the current job will show as Waiting for selection , which means you must select the content you want to import . View the other content from any completed imports by accessing any link in Course Navigation. The import may also display other status indicators as part of the import process.",

What are Discussions? Canvas provides an integrated system for class discussions, allowing both instructors and students to start and contribute to as many discussion topics as desired. Discussions allows for interactive communication between two or more people; users can participate in a conversation with an entire class or group. Discussions can also be created as an assignment for grading purposes (and seamlessly integrated with the Canvas Gradebook), or simply serve as a forum for topical and current events. Discussions can also be created within student groups. Discussion topics can be organized as focused or threaded discussions. Focused discussions only allow for two levels of nesting, the original post and subsequent replies. Threaded discussions allow for infinite levels of nesting. Focused discussions are relatively short-lived interactions, while threaded discussions allow replies within replies and may last for a longer period of time.  Focused Discussions Focused discussions are relatively short-lived interactions that tend to disappear as the course progresses, such as a weekly forum for questions related to that week's activities. Use a focused discussion for single posts and related comments. One discussion leader typically posts a message and multiple learners comment on it. Participants may leave a side comment to a reply, but cannot develop the conversation beyond two layers of nesting. Focused discussions might also be used to: Answer a single question. Share resources amongst peers. Collect results from a simple research activity. Share solutions to a single problem. Correct misconceptions. Clarify course policies. Get feedback on a work in progress. Share insights about a single reading. Threaded discussions Threaded discussions include infinite layers of response nesting, allowing commenters to continue responding on a single nested thread. Threaded discussions lend themselves to the refining of complex ideas. Responses and different lines of inquiry can be quickly navigated due to its hierarchical structure. Threaded discussions may be long-standing spaces for thoughts that persist throughout an entire course. Use a threaded discussion for multiple posts and related comments. One or more discussion leaders post a message and multiple learners comment on it with the freedom to create any number of related discussion topics and comments. Threaded Discussions might also be used to: Post and answer multiple related or unrelated questions. Organize results from a complex research activity. Share and iterate upon ideas shared by each student in the course. Debate the pros and cons of a single issue or multiple issues. Ask multiple questions of a single discussion leader. Refine ideas between multiple discussion leaders and multiple learners. Facilitate group discussions around multiple topics. Facilitate discussions around a discussion (fishbowl conversations). Explore at length the feasibility of different solutions to a complex problem. How do I use Discussions as an Instructor? Within Discussions you can: Create , edit, and delete discussion topics.

What are External Apps (LTI Tools)? LTI provides a framework through which an LMS (Canvas) can send some verifiable information about a user to a third party. By default, most user information is anonymized, but this can be changed when the configuration is first set up. External Apps can be configured on the account or course level.  How Standardization Enhances EdTech Integration Across LMS Platforms The EdTech ecosystem includes multiple learning management systems (LMSs) such as Canvas, D2L, Blackboard, Moodle, and others. Each LMS may use its own data model and terminology for organizing information. For example, a student’s ID field might be labeled as StudentID, LearnerID, or StudentIdentification, depending on the platform. When a tool integrates with multiple LMSs, these differences present a challenge. If each LMS has its own way of identifying information, the tool must create separate, customized integrations for each platform. This is a significant expense, both in initial development and ongoing maintenance. How LTI Streamlines EdTech Integration Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a set of standards that enables LMSs to share a common endpoint. This allows a single educational tool to be developed once and used across multiple platforms, eliminating the need for custom integrations. LTI enhances the EdTech ecosystem by making a wider array of tools available in all environments. The LTI specifications are developed and maintained by 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global). How LTI works LTI provides a framework that allows an LMS, such as Canvas, to send verifiable user information to a third-party tool. For LTI to function, the third party must provide a consumer key and shared secret, which Canvas uses to generate a signature verifying the authenticity of the transmitted data. By default, most user information is anonymized, but these settings can be adjusted during the initial configuration. When Would I Use An External App? External Apps add functionality to a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may want to include a study aid (flashcards, mini-quizzes, etc.) to help students better understand the concepts being taught. Admins can add external apps for accounts and subaccounts via XML, URL, or manual configuration. If apps do not already exist for a course, instructors can add external apps in their courses to create additional learning paths for students. External apps can be added to Modules, Course Navigation, the Rich Content Editor, and Assignments. In the Rich Content Editor, external apps can be accessed from the Apps icon or added to the toolbar for an account . How to Configure External Apps External apps using LTI can be configured at either the account level or the course level, providing flexibility in how tools are deployed within an institution. By standardizing integrations across LMS platforms, LTI streamlines the implementation of educational tools, reducing costs and increasing the availability of resources for educators and learners alike.

Admins can manage the apps that can be used in courses for accounts and subaccounts by creating an allow list in the Edu App Center and managing the allow list in Canvas. What Does LTI Have to Do With Canvas? Canvas is considered an LTI platform. This means that tools can be launched from within Canvas. The places tools can be launched from are called Placements—some examples include the Rich Content Editor, assignments, and the left-hand navigation bar. When a tool is launched from one of these locations, it receives information about the context from which it was launched,|Document Title: What are External Apps LTI Tools

the Rich Content Editor, assignments, and the left-hand navigation bar. When a tool is launched from one of these locations, it receives information about the context from which it was launched, such as the placement location, the user who launched it, and the course it was launched from. The tool can then use this information to determine what the user should see and what actions they should be able to perform. A tool can send information back to Canvas through the Assignments and Grade Service (AGS) or Deep Linking. Both of these methods are described in more detail in the LTI documentation linked below. Data sent back through these methods is stored in Canvas databases as appropriate. The image below may help you visualize the connections between the different pieces. Account Vs Course Level Installs LTI tools can be installed at the account or course levels. The same features are generally available for both, though installations at the course level cannot use global placements. Account-level installations are available in all courses, whereas course-level installations are only available in the specified course. For LTI 1.3 tools, the developer key must be installed at the account level, but the actual installation can occur at the course, account, or subaccount level. Differences between LTI 1.1 And 1.3 LTI 1.1 was the original Learning Tools Interoperability specification. LTI 1.1 tools can be installed via EduAppCenter or by accessing Canvas and going to Settings > Apps > View App Configurations, then clicking + App and adding a tool manually, by URL, or by pasting XML. LTI 1.3 is a newer version of the specification that improves the security of the authentication process. It is also extensible, meaning that 1EdTech can add more features to it without breaking the existing specification. These features are called services or specifications. There is a required set for all platforms, including the Core Service, Names and Roles Provisioning Service, Assignments and Grade Service, and Deep Linking. Other services are optional and can be added depending on specific needs. In Canvas, LTI 1.3 requires an admin to set up a developer key in Settings, and then a user can add the tool at either the account or course level by pasting in the Client ID. Canvas' implementation of LTI 1.3 supports all placements from LTI 1.1, and our public documentation reflects LTI 1.3 as the standard moving forward.

What are External Apps (LTI Tools)? LTI provides a framework through which an LMS (Canvas) can send some verifiable information about a user to a third party. By default, most user information is anonymized, but this can be changed when the configuration is first set up. External Apps can be configured on the account or course level.  How Standardization Enhances EdTech Integration Across LMS Platforms The EdTech ecosystem includes multiple learning management systems (LMSs) such as Canvas, D2L, Blackboard, Moodle, and others. Each LMS may use its own data model and terminology for organizing information. For example, a student’s ID field might be labeled as StudentID, LearnerID, or StudentIdentification, depending on the platform. When a tool integrates with multiple LMSs, these differences present a challenge. If each LMS has its own way of identifying information, the tool must create separate, customized integrations for each platform. This is a significant expense, both in initial development and ongoing maintenance. How LTI Streamlines EdTech Integration Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a set of standards that enables LMSs to share a common endpoint. This allows a single educational tool to be developed once and used across multiple platforms, eliminating the need for custom integrations. LTI enhances the EdTech ecosystem by making a wider array of tools available in all environments. The LTI specifications are developed and maintained by 1EdTech (formerly IMS Global). How LTI works LTI provides a framework that allows an LMS, such as Canvas, to send verifiable user information to a third-party tool. For LTI to function, the third party must provide a consumer key and shared secret, which Canvas uses to generate a signature verifying the authenticity of the transmitted data. By default, most user information is anonymized, but these settings can be adjusted during the initial configuration. When Would I Use An External App? External Apps add functionality to a Canvas course. For example, an instructor may want to include a study aid (flashcards, mini-quizzes, etc.) to help students better understand the concepts being taught. Admins can add external apps for accounts and subaccounts via XML, URL, or manual configuration. If apps do not already exist for a course, instructors can add external apps in their courses to create additional learning paths for students. External apps can be added to Modules, Course Navigation, the Rich Content Editor, and Assignments. In the Rich Content Editor, external apps can be accessed from the Apps icon or added to the toolbar for an account . How to Configure External Apps External apps using LTI can be configured at either the account level or the course level, providing flexibility in how tools are deployed within an institution. By standardizing integrations across LMS platforms, LTI streamlines the implementation of educational tools, reducing costs and increasing the availability of resources for educators and learners alike. When Would I Use The Canvas App Center? Admins and instructors can also enable apps through the App Center, which is integrated directly in Canvas.

What are grading schemes? A grading scheme is a set of criteria that measures varying levels of achievement in a course. Account-level grading schemes are grading schemes that can be defined at the account or sub-account level for the entire institution. On a course level, instructors can apply grading schemes to both students' final grades and individual assignments. Without a grading scheme, scores are not measured against any specific standard. Notes: Account-level grading schemes automatically appear within all courses in the account. When an instructor links a grading scheme created at the account level, the grading scheme is linked, not imported, as a new scheme on the course level. Grading schemes imported from the account level can only be modified by users with grading scheme permissions. Grading schemes created at the account level automatically appear on the sub-account level.  Common Grading Schemes Grading schemes are built based on percentage ranges, and each percentage range is assigned a name value. You can create any type of grading scheme by editing the name and percentage range for each item. Notes about Grading Schemes: Grading schemes only support two decimal places. The only scores allowed in the Gradebook are those defined in the grading scheme. Gradebook entries that are not specifically defined in the grading scheme display a dash. A grading scheme in use can be archived and then restored to an active state. An archived grading scheme cannot be leveraged in the future by a course or assignment unless the scheme is restored. The default Canvas grading scheme cannot be archived. When copying or exporting a course, archived default grading schemes are not copied or exported. Editing the name and description of grading schemes currently in use does not allow edits to percentages or points in the grading scheme. A grading scheme established at the course level cannot be deleted, archived, or edited at the account level. A grading scheme created at the account level cannot be deleted, archived, or edited at the course level. Letter Grades Letter Grades is the most traditional type of grading scheme and is the default format for new grading schemes. Remember, only supported scores are allowed in the Gradebook, so if you build a letter grade scheme with name values for only A, B, and C, you cannot enter a score that converts to an A- or B+. In the Gradebook, scores are inputted by point value, percentage, or letter grade. For instance, if an assignment is worth 10 points and the student earns 9, you can input 9 or 90% (which will display as an A- as defined in the percentage range). You can also input an A- directly. GPA Scale GPA Scale Grading is designed for schools that use a 4.0 scale (or 5.0/6.0). GPA Scale calculations may vary by institution. This scheme is similar to the Letter Grade scheme, but letter grades can also be used. Remember, only supported scores are allowed in the Gradebook, so if you build a GPA scheme with name values for only 4.0 and 3.9, you cannot enter a score of 3.95. In the Gradebook, scores are inputted by percentage or GPA value. For instance, if an assignment is worth 10 points and the student earns 9, you can input 90% (which will display as a 3.7 as defined in the percentage range). You can also input 3.7 directly. Inputting a 9 will not work. Performance Performance grading schemes are based on a standard of individual performance. Remember, only supported scores are allowed in the Gradebook, so if you build a performance scheme with the name values of only Excellent and Poor, you cannot enter a score of Good. In the Gradebook, scores are inputted by points, percentage, or performance value. For instance, if an assignment is worth 10 points and the student earns 9, you can input 9 or 90% (which will display as Excellent as defined in the percentage range).

What are Outcomes? Outcomes allow the administration and faculty to track mastery in a course. Users can import Account, State, and Common Core Standards into an account and course.  Account or Course Outcomes Outcomes enables the administration and faculty to track students’ progress as measured by pedagogical goals or desired outcomes. Assessments created to test student knowledge or to require students to demonstrate a specific skill resulting from a learning activity can be aligned to learning outcomes using rubrics (which can be used for grading simultaneously). Grading student work automatically collects and compiles data on student progress for the Outcomes. The data is available for reporting to support teaching improvement, identify at-risk students, and support the accreditation process. This unified, streamlined approach dramatically reduces the amount of work required to implement Learning Outcomes through the intelligent reuse of assessment workflows in the grading process. When would I use Outcomes? Use Outcomes to: Focus students' attention on the most important skills and activities in your course (find existing outcomes or create new ones) Align Quizzes and Assignments to different kinds of mastery Run reports at the account-level about student artifacts of learning mastery Assess student progress through calculation methods Track student progress on a learning outcome or overall in the Learning Mastery Gradebook Align accreditation or other core standards to programs of study, courses, or student assessments Calculation Methods When users create an outcome, users can set one of four calculation methods used for student mastery: Weighted Average, Decaying Average, n Number of Times, Most Recent Score, and Highest Score. Calculation methods are used in conjunction within the Learning Mastery Gradebook. Calculation methods can be set when creating custom course outcomes (instructors) or creating custom account outcomes (admins). Notes: For new Outcomes created in the Canvas interface, the default calculation is Weighted Average unless changed to another calculation. For new Outcomes created using the Outcomes API, the default calculation is set as Highest Score but can be modified with the appropriate parameters. If a user imports an outcome but does not have permission to modify the calculation method, the calculation method cannot be changed. Common Core outcomes are always calculated as Highest Score; however, the calculation method can be modified using the Outcomes API by any user with appropriate admin permissions. Weighted Average The Weighted Average calculation factors the average of all assessment items while weighing the most recent (current) submission to any assignment associated with this outcome at a higher percentage. By default, the Canvas weighted average is set at 65/35, meaning the current item is weighted at 65%, and the average of all other user scores is weighted at 35%. However, users can specify between 1% and 99% for the current percentage, and prior scores are weighted against the percentage difference. Note that the average is rounded to the next two decimals. If there is only one result, then the single score will be displayed. For example, a student has four aligned items with scores of 4, 3, 2, and 5 (scores listed chronologically from oldest to most recent). If the current item is set to be weighted at 65% of mastery, prior scores are weighted at 35%: Current item score: 5 Average of prior item scores: (4 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 3 Calculated score: 5 (.65) + 3 (.35) = 3.25 + 1.05 = 4.3 Decaying Average The Decaying Average calculation uses a formula to determine proficiency based on students' average scores, giving more weight to the most recent scored. To determine the weight given to the most recent score, the formula uses a decay rate. The higher the formula's decay rate, the more heavily the most recent assessment is weighted. By default, the decay weight is set at 65%. However, you can adjust the rate to any percentage between 50% and 99%. Between two assessments, the most recent assessment gets 65% weight and the first gets 35%. For each additional assessment, the sum of the|Document Title: What are Outcomes

For example, a student has scores of 1, 2, 3, 4 (scores listed chronologically from oldest to most recent): (1 × .35) + (2 × .65) = X (X × .35) + (3 × .65) = Y (Y × .35) + (4 × .65) = Z  (this being the current standard score; 3.48) n Number of Times The n Number of Times calculation requires a specific number of times that mastery must be met or exceeded, and the number of aligned items that must be completed for calculation eligibility. Any scores that do not meet mastery are not part of the calculation. Users can specify between 1 and 10 items required for mastery. For example, a student is required to achieve mastery 2 times with a mastery score of 5. If the student has scores of 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, and 6, only the scores of 5 and 6 would be part of the calculation. Average score of eligible items: 5 + 6 = 11 Calculated score: 11 / 2 = 5.5 Most Recent Score The Most Recent Score calculation always selects the most recent score for all assessment items.

What are Outcomes? Outcomes allow the administration and faculty to track mastery in a course. Users can import Account, State, and Common Core Standards into an account and course.  Account or Course Outcomes Outcomes enables the administration and faculty to track students’ progress as measured by pedagogical goals or desired outcomes. Assessments created to test student knowledge or to require students to demonstrate a specific skill resulting from a learning activity can be aligned to learning outcomes using rubrics (which can be used for grading simultaneously). Grading student work automatically collects and compiles data on student progress for the Outcomes. The data is available for reporting to support teaching improvement, identify at-risk students, and support the accreditation process. This unified, streamlined approach dramatically reduces the amount of work required to implement Learning Outcomes through the intelligent reuse of assessment workflows in the grading process. When would I use Outcomes? Use Outcomes to: Focus students' attention on the most important skills and activities in your course (find existing outcomes or create new ones) Align Quizzes and Assignments to different kinds of mastery Run reports at the account-level about student artifacts of learning mastery Assess student progress through calculation methods Track student progress on a learning outcome or overall in the Learning Mastery Gradebook Align accreditation or other core standards to programs of study, courses, or student assessments Calculation Methods When users create an outcome, users can set one of four calculation methods used for student mastery: Weighted Average, Decaying Average, n Number of Times, Most Recent Score, and Highest Score. Calculation methods are used in conjunction within the Learning Mastery Gradebook. Calculation methods can be set when creating custom course outcomes (instructors) or creating custom account outcomes (admins). Notes: For new Outcomes created in the Canvas interface, the default calculation is Weighted Average unless changed to another calculation. For new Outcomes created using the Outcomes API, the default calculation is set as Highest Score but can be modified with the appropriate parameters. If a user imports an outcome but does not have permission to modify the calculation method, the calculation method cannot be changed. Common Core outcomes are always calculated as Highest Score; however, the calculation method can be modified using the Outcomes API by any user with appropriate admin permissions. Weighted Average The Weighted Average calculation factors the average of all assessment items while weighing the most recent (current) submission to any assignment associated with this outcome at a higher percentage. By default, the Canvas weighted average is set at 65/35, meaning the current item is weighted at 65%, and the average of all other user scores is weighted at 35%. However, users can specify between 1% and 99% for the current percentage, and prior scores are weighted against the percentage difference. Note that the average is rounded to the next two decimals. If there is only one result, then the single score will be displayed. For example, a student has four aligned items with scores of 4, 3, 2, and 5 (scores listed chronologically from oldest to most recent). If the current item is set to be weighted at 65% of mastery, prior scores are weighted at 35%: Current item score: 5 Average of prior item scores: (4 + 3 + 2) / 3 = 3 Calculated score: 5 (.65) + 3 (.35) = 3.25 + 1.05 = 4.3 Decaying Average The Decaying Average calculation uses a formula to determine proficiency based on students' average scores, giving more weight to the most recent scored.

What are Peer Reviews?
A peer review assignment or discussion enables students to provide feedback on another student's submission. Peer reviews allow communication between students and can help students master the concepts of a course and learn from each other. Peer reviews can be assigned to show student names or display anonymously.
Note:
Students can only view peer review assignments or discussions after they have submitted their own work for the assignment or replied to the discussion themselves.
When Would I Use Peer Reviews?
Student peer review assignments and discussions can:
Help students develop critical thinking skills by evaluating and providing feedback on their peers' work.
Enhance understanding of the subject matter.
Improve communication skills.
Promote a collaborative learning environment.
Teach students to give and receive constructive criticism.
Instructors can

or
create a peer review discussion
.
Perform Peer Reviews
After submitting their own work, students can
submit a peer review
[1]. The student whose work was reviewed can then
view their peer’s feedback

Anonymous Peer Reviews
As part of creating a peer review, the anonymous option allows you to hide the name of the student reviewer from the student with the submission. The reviewer cannot see the name of the assigned person whose work is to be reviewed, and the student who submitted the assignment cannot view names associated with any comments.
Creating an anonymous peer review can reduce bias, encourage honest feedback, promote fairness, minimize pressure, and focus on learning.
Notes:
Email notifications sent to students about peer reviews are anonymous. Student reviewers cannot view the name of the person whose work they are reviewing.
Once a peer review has been assigned, the viewing setting cannot be changed. For instance, a regular peer review cannot later be made anonymous—and appear anonymous—unless the peer review is deleted and re-assigned.
Canvas DocViewer does not support anonymous comments, so it cannot be used for annotated feedback on assignments with anonymous peer reviews.
When anonymous peer reviews are enabled, instructors and TAs can still view the names of student reviewers in SpeedGrader and in the student submission page. However, if
anonymous grading is enabled in SpeedGrader
, the names of both students will be hidden in SpeedGrader but not in the student submission page.",

   • No further action is needed—students can’t see the link, so you don’t need to hide it  

After these steps, every course in your account will display the Roll Call Attendance link in Course Navigation.","Document Title: What is the Roll Call Attendance Tool

What is the Roll Call Attendance Tool? The Attendance (Roll Call) tool is an external app (LTI) used for taking attendance in Canvas courses. The Attendance tool can be used for online or face-to-face courses. Enabled at the account level, the Roll Call Attendance tool can be used by all courses in the Canvas account. The Attendance tool always appears as a visible Course Navigation link, but it cannot be viewed by students, so hiding the link in Course Settings is not necessary. If instructors do not want to use the Attendance tool in their courses, no action is required. However, if you do use the Attendance tool, students can view their attendance report in the Gradebook through the Roll Call Attendance submission details page. Note: The Attendance tool must be enabled for your institution before it can be used in Canvas courses. If you are an admin, contact your Customer Success Manager for assistance.  View Attendance With the Attendance tool, instructors can keep track of course attendance by taking roll electronically. Instructors can choose to view the tool in a list or grid format and can customize the placement of each student in the seating chart. View Attendance Assignment When you take attendance using Roll Call, Canvas automatically adds Attendance as an assignment. The default point value for attendance is 100 points. To avoid Attendance calculation errors, never delete, rename, or unpublish the Attendance assignment. Note: Although students cannot view the actual attendance tool, they can still view the attendance assignment in the Assignments page. This assignment cannot be hidden from students. Take Attendance The status set for each student is associated with a percentage value. Statuses include present and on time, not present, late, and unmarked (excused absence). The Attendance tool also creates an assignment in the Gradebook and calculates attendance as a percentage of a student's grade. View Lateness Value By default, the value of being late is 80% of the present value. So if a student is late, the student will receive 80% for the day instead of the full 100%. The late value can be adjusted in Roll Call settings. View Gradebook Scores In the Gradebook Attendance column, by default, Canvas displays the assignment based on percentage of the point value. For instance, if the point value is 100, and roll call has been taken twice, a student with one present value (100%) and one lateness value (calculated at 80%) will have a score of 90 points, or 90%. The Attendance Gradebook column will update every time you take roll call in the Attendance tool. Note: Although students cannot view the actual attendance tool, if you are using attendance for grading, they can still view their attendance score in their Grades page and view their attendance report. You can prevent the assignment from triggering notifications by setting a manual posting policy for the assignment . Export Attendance Data At both the account and course levels, the Attendance tool allows users to create attendance reports. Note: Admins can also filter reports by SIS Course ID. Create and Manage Badges At the account level, admins can create and manage badges used in the Attendance Tool. At the course level, any badges added by a Canvas admin automatically appear for the course. However, instructors can also create additional badges for their course as needed.",
"How can I enable the Roll Call LTI in Canvas, record attendance (list or grid seating), set lateness, manage badges, and export attendance reports?",,"1. Enable Roll Call LTI  
   - Ensure the Attendance (Roll Call) tool is enabled at your institution’s Canvas account level.  
   - If it isn’t enabled, contact your Customer Success Manager or Canvas admin to activate the LTI.

2. Access and Record Attendance  
   - In your course navigation, click Attendance.  
   - Choose List view or Grid (seating chart) view.  
   - In Grid view, drag student icons to arrange seating as needed.  
   - Click each student’s status to mark Present, Late, Not Present, or Excused.

3. Set or Adjust Lateness Value  
   - Within the Attendance tool, open Roll Call Settings.  
   - Find the “Late” percentage and adjust the default (80%) to your preferred value.  
   - Save changes to apply the new lateness weight.

4. Manage Badges  
   - At the account level, admins navigate to Account → Roll Call Badges to create or edit badges.  
   - Instructors can add course-level badges by opening Attendance and selecting Add Badge.  
   - Badges created by admins automatically appear in all courses.

5. Export Attendance Reports

What are Rubrics? Rubrics are a way to set up custom or Outcome-based assessment criteria for scoring. A Rubric is an assessment tool for communicating expectations of quality. Rubrics are typically comprised of rows and columns. Rows are used to define the various criteria being used to assess an assignment. Columns are used to define levels of performance for each criterion. Rubrics can be set up as non-scoring rubrics, which allows for assessment-based and outcome-based grading without points. View a video about account-level rubrics or view a video about course-level rubrics . If enabled, the Rubric Enhancements feature option provides visual and functional enhancements to rubrics across Canvas.  Account Rubrics Account-level rubrics are rubrics that are created at the account or sub-account level. They can be used by any course within that account or sub-account for assignments, discussions, or quizzes. If an account-level rubric is used in more than one place, it becomes uneditable, but is still usable. Account-level rubrics can be used to create institutional or departmental question repositories. The purpose of account-level rubrics is to provide resources for teachers, not control content. For example, if the English department offered several courses to teach basic grammar rules to students, a department could create a sub-account level rubric. Instructors could then access the rubric to offer the same evaluation standards to students in different courses. Course Rubrics Course-level rubrics are either created at the course level or copied from the account or sub-account level.

"How do I update SIS data in Canvas using a CSV file? I see options like standard, FB, MT, and UI override modes; which one should I pick and in what order?",,"1. Prepare your CSV files  
   • Use Instructure format in this file order: users, accounts, terms, courses, sections, enrollments, logins.  
   • Either upload each .csv individually or compress them into a single .zip.  

2. Choose your import mode  
   • Standard (default) – Processes only rows in your file. Good for frequent, incremental updates (e.g., new enrollments).  
   • Full Batch (FB) – Syncs your Canvas data exactly to the CSV: removes any previously imported records not in the file. Use when you need to delete stale courses or enrollments.  
   • Multi-Term (MT) – Via the API, run a single import across multiple terms. Enable in your SIS import call and set a change threshold. Use when you manage several terms at once.  
   • UI Override – Forces Canvas to overwrite “sticky” UI changes (full name, sortable name, institutional email). Two sub-options:  
     – Process as UI changes (marks imported data as if manually edited)  
     – Clear UI-changed state (removes stickiness so future imports can overwrite)  

3. Determine your order  
   a. Initial setup (first import): use FB to seed data and delete unwanted records.  
   b. Term-by-term operations: switch to Standard imports for day-to-day enrolment or roster updates.  
   c. Cross-term bulk updates: use MT via API if you need to update multiple terms at once.  
   d. Data reconciliation: apply UI Override when you must re-sync names or emails that users have changed in the Canvas UI.

   • Go to Admin > SIS Imports, select your CSV or ZIP, choose your mode, and submit.  
   • Review the import log for errors and confirm data updated as expected.","Document Title: What are SIS Imports

What are SIS Imports? The SIS Imports feature allows you to upload and integrate data from various Student Information Systems (SIS), complex databases, and even simple spreadsheets as comma separated value (CSV) files. Admins can use this feature to create users, accounts, courses, enrollments, logins, and more. Only admins with the correct permissions can import and manage SIS data. For more information please see the Canvas Account Permissions resource document . View a video about SIS Imports .  When would I use SIS imports? With SIS imports, you can: Import SIS data with CSV files or automatically import via the Canvas API Import SIS data with IMS Enterprise Specification XML zip files Import SIS data with Banner Grade Exchange Results XML Create an automated data integration with Canvas Import Types The SIS Import page supports a few formats for standard imports to Canvas: Instructure formatted CSV or zipfile of CSVs, IMS Enterprise Specification XML zip, or Banner Grade Exchange Results XML. A standard import only processes changes that are specifically listed in the upload file and is an efficient way to upload a few records. For example, if a student enrollment was listed as active in a prior import but not present in the current enrollment, no change will take place to the student enrollment. The enrollment will remain active until marked as deleted or completed in a standard import (or is marked as not present in a Full Batch update for the term where the course is listed). During the beginning of a term, course enrollments change regularly; submitting a standard import frequently helps keep enrollments current in an account. When uploading SIS data with CSV files, you may import an individual CSV text file or you may compress multiple files into a single ZIP file to bulk import data. If you are using the Instructure format for importing files, the files should be in the following order: users, accounts, terms, courses, sections, enrollments, and logins. Full Batch Updates Canvas supports full batch updates for each import type. This option will only affect data that has been involved in a previous SIS job – either created by a previous import, or referenced by a SIS job after a SIS ID was manually added. Manually created courses with no SIS ID, for example, won't be deleted even if they don't appear in the new SIS import. For enrollments, this option means the linked user and course/sections require SIS IDs. A Canvas record will be deleted if it is not included in the current import file. This option can delete large data sets without any prompt or warning for confirmation and affects data created in previous SIS imports. Full batch updates are useful if: Your source SIS software doesn't have a way to send delete records as part of an import, and you need to remove a fair portion of the imported data You want to be sure your current enrollment and data set are consistent with your SIS enrollment and course data Your SIS doesn't track changes to course state or enrollments for students and/or teachers You want to delete courses that you have migrated to Canvas from another LMS Multi Term Batch Mode If you want to run a batch against all terms in the same import, you can enable multi term batch mode. This mode can only be enabled in the API and requires a change threshold as noted in the SIS Import Format Documentation . UI Overrides Canvas supports user interface (UI) overrides through SIS imports. When a user makes changes to certain data fields in Canvas (e.g., a user's name), this change is ""sticky"" and is set as the new default. Selecting the Override UI option allows Canvas to overwrite any ""sticky"" data updated in the Canvas UI. Otherwise, attempting an import with conflicting data would be disregarded and the existing user data would not be changed. To view the full list of ""sticky"" data fields, see the SIS Imported Format Documentation . This option may be useful if: You forgot to restrict user options in account settings, such as allowing users to change their names, delete their institution-assigned email address, etc., and you want to run an update to be sure they are in sync. Note that this will NOT|Document Title: What are SIS Imports

settings, such as allowing users to change their names, delete their institution-assigned email address, etc., and you want to run an update to be sure they are in sync. Note that this will NOT impact the user's display name if they changed it. Only the full name and sortable name would be changed. You allowed them to change their names (above example) on purpose, but want to periodically sync with your current data. You want to maintain control over the names of users and courses, or if you know a name change occurred for a user or course. Overriding UI changes also allows one of two additional options: process as UI changes or clear UI-changed state. Process as UI changes. This option overrides changes that have taken place in the UI as ""sticky"" data; all data acts as if the changes were actually manually updated in the UI. This option may be useful if: You don't want subsequent imports to overwrite the data you are currently importing. Clear UI-changed state. This option removes the ""stickiness"" of all data that exists in this import; future imports with this data will not indicate any data in the UI as ""sticky"". This option may be useful if: You accidentally checked the ""Process as UI changes"" option and you need to fix the affected data. You forgot to remove the ability for users to rename themselves, course names, or remove the institutional email and you want to clear the stickiness of the UI changes that have occurred.",
How can I set up a full batch update when importing my SIS CSV in Canvas to automatically remove enrollments for students no longer listed?,,"1. Prepare your Instructure-formatted CSV (or ZIP of CSVs) in the correct order (users, accounts, terms, courses, sections, enrollments, logins).  
2. In Canvas, go to Admin > Your Account > SIS Imports.  
3. For Import Type, select **Full Batch Update**.  
4. Upload your CSV or ZIP and click **Upload**.  
   - Full batch mode will remove any existing enrollment (or other SIS-managed records) not present in this import for items already stamped with a SIS ID.  
5. Monitor the import job; once complete, Canvas will automatically delete enrollments of students no longer listed.  

(Optional API method)  
• POST to `/api/v1/accounts/:account_id/sis_imports` with `batch_mode=true` and your CSV or ZIP attached to achieve the same full‐batch behavior.","Document Title: What are SIS Imports

"How do student and instructor roles, and customizations to the institution’s Help menu, change which links are displayed and which fields appear on support tickets?",,"Here’s how roles and Help‐menu customizations affect which links you see and what fields appear on the “Report a Problem” form:

1. Role-Based Link Display  
   - Students see the standard student links (e.g., Search the Canvas Guides, COVID-19 Resources, Report a Problem, Ask Your Instructor, Ask the Community, Submit a Feature Idea, Show Welcome Tour).  
   - Instructors see all student links plus instructor-only links (e.g., Training Services Portal).  

2. Institution Customizations  
   - Admins can reorder, hide, or remove any default link (including “Report a Problem”) and designate which link is featured or labeled “New.”  
   - Admins can add custom links (for example, phone numbers, institutional support pages, or specialized resources).  
   - If “Report a Problem” is hidden, users must use an alternate link or contact method to submit tickets.  

3. “Report a Problem” Ticket Fields  
   Regardless of role or menu customizations, the ticket form itself includes:  
   • Subject – brief summary of the issue  
   • Description – detailed information (user name/email, URL where the error occurs, steps to reproduce, screenshots/screencasts, and what you’ve tried so far)  
   • How is this affecting you? – drop-down with options from “Just a casual question” to “EXTREMELY CRITICAL EMERGENCY”

Mobile Browsers
You can access Canvas from any

How do I add and duplicate an event for course sections in the Calendar? When creating a calendar event as an instructor, if you want to create the same event multiple times for a course, you can create a duplicate event. Duplicating events creates multiple copies of the event every day, week, or month. For example, you may create a duplicate course event for student study groups every week. You will not grade students on whether or not they have participated in the study group, but you are providing a resource activity on a specific day to help them organize their time and prepare for your course more efficiently. Once created in a course calendar, duplicate events are not linked together and are independent events. Therefore, if users need to modify an event, each event has to be modified individually. Additionally, duplicate events can only be created when creating a new event; editing an existing event does not display the duplicate option. You can also create recurring calendar events . Tips for duplicate events: Weekly events are duplicated on the day of the week of the first event. For instance, if an event is created on a Monday and repeats weekly, the next instance of the event will appear on the following Monday, regardless of the actual date.‬ ‪Monthly events are duplicated on the day of the month of the first event. For instance, if an event is created on July 6 and repeats monthly, the next instance of the event will appear on August 6. ‬ Note: Events that include a conferencing link in the description or location field display a Join button on students' List View Dashboard.

Course nicknames can be set in place of sidebar course codes that are long or otherwise confusing to remember which courses they represent. If you have created a nickname for a course, the nickname displays in the sidebar instead of the course code . However, the original course code always displays in the course card. View Instructor Sections The sidebar helps you manage grading in all of your courses. However, assignments that are not graded or do not require an online submission only display until the due date. The To Do section shows all items that require grading in Canvas, regardless of due date . Each item in the To Do list displays the assignment name, the course name, the number of points, and the due date for the assignment. Some assignments may display multiple due dates. The Coming Up section shows assignments and events coming due in the next seven days . Items can include ungraded quizzes and assignments that do not require a submission, though these assignment types do not display in the To Do grading list for instructors. Some items may display multiple due dates. The Coming Up section displays up to 20 items ordered according to date. If your Canvas admin has granted you permission to create courses, you may see the Start a New Course button , which would allow you to create a new Canvas Course. The View Grades button links to the Dashboard Grades page and displays the overall grade average for all your active courses . Manage Sidebar Items Each section item indicates how many items need to be graded . By default, Grade Assignment links open to SpeedGrader in a new browser tab . You can prevent Grade Assignment links from opening in a new tab in your User Account Feature Option Settings . If a section contains more items than are listed, a link will appear under the list that you can use to view all to-do items . The To Do section shows up to seven items with due dates in the upcoming weeks. To view more items, you must manually remove items from the list. To remove a To Do item, click the remove icon . Note: When an item is removed, the item can only be restored to the To Do section if a new submission is received for that assignment.",

How do I set usage rights and user access for a file or folder? If the copyright and license information requirement is enabled in your course or account, you have to set a usage right (copyright) for each file you upload to your course. Usage rights must be assigned to files before files can be published to the course. If the copyright and license information requirement is enabled in your course, you can set usage rights for all files that currently exist within a folder. Folders themselves cannot hold a usage right attribute, so the folder passes the usage right to the existing files in the folder at the time the usage right is defined. Therefore, you can create a folder, add all files to the folder, and then define the usage right for the folder and apply the right to all files at once. This action does not apply to any files added to the folder after the usage right is set. If additional files are added at a later time, you will have to reset the usage right for the folder or set file usage rights individually.

Therefore, you can create a folder, add all files to the folder, and then define the usage right for the folder and apply the right to all files at once. This action does not apply to any files added to the folder after the usage right is set. If additional files are added at a later time, you will have to reset the usage right for the folder or set file usage rights individually.

How do I change my login password in my user account? You may be able to change your password in your user settings. If you do not have access to change your password, your password is controlled through your institution. Contact your institution to learn how to change your password.

Here are some good password guidelines: Use at least eight characters (the more the better), but most people will find anything more than about 15 characters difficult to remember. Use a random mixture of characters, upper and lower case, numbers, punctuation, spaces and symbols. Don't use a word found in a dictionary, English or foreign.

How do I manage API access tokens in my user account? You can manage API access tokens from your User Settings. Access tokens provide access to Canvas resources through the Canvas API. Access tokens can be generated automatically for third-party applications or created manually. Using the Canvas API allows the access token holder to access the same Canvas resources that you can access. For example, third-party applications, including devices you have used to open the Canvas Student app, are authorized to access Canvas on your behalf. For more information on using the Canvas API, view the Canvas API documentation . Note: If you are an admin, you can limit the ability to manage access tokens to admins only. Access tokens should be treated with the same level of security as your account password. Never share your access token, and immediately revoke a token if you suspect it has been exposed or compromised. It is a violation of Canvas API policy for a user to generate an access token to insert into an application. Applications must use approved authentication methods instead.

"How does uploading large videos (over 500 MB) directly to Canvas compare to hosting them externally when it comes to where the files are stored, who can access them, adding captions, and how they appear to students?",,"1. File storage  
   • Canvas upload (≤500 MB): media files live in your course’s Uploaded Media folder under User Files (or Group Files).  
   • External host (>500 MB): files reside on the external platform (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo), not in Canvas.  

2. Access control  
   • Canvas upload: governed by Canvas file restrictions (publish status, availability dates, usage rights). Students can only view when the course/content is published and within visibility windows.  
   • External host: controlled by the host’s privacy settings (public, unlisted, private). Embedded videos respect both the host’s and Canvas’s access controls.  

3. Adding captions  
   • Canvas upload: you can upload a caption or subtitle file (.vtt, .srt) directly in the Media Uploader (check “Add CC/Subtitles”).  
   • External host: you add captions via the host’s captioning tools (e.g., YouTube’s subtitle upload or auto-caption features).  

4. Student view  
   • Canvas upload: video embeds inline in the Rich Content Editor with Canvas’s native player, captions toggle directly in Canvas.  
   • External host: video embeds via an iframe or LTI tool; students use the host’s player UI (branding, player controls, and caption toggle depend on the external service).","Document Title: How do I upload and embed a media file from my computer in the

How do I use the Accessibility Checker in the Rich Content Editor? The Rich Content Editor includes an accessibility tool that detects common accessibility errors within the editor. You can use the Accessibility Checker to design course content while considering accessibility attributes. This tool only verifies content created within the Rich Content Editor. You may use other accessibility tools to verify additional content in Canvas. All accessibility components retain the parameters set by your institution's Theme Editor template. The Accessibility Checker verifies the following accessibility rules: Adjacent links: Adjacent links with the same URL should be a single link. This rule verifies link errors where the link text may include spaces and break the link into multiple links. Heading paragraphs: Headings should not contain more than 120 characters. Image alt text: Images should include an alt attribute describing the image content. Image alt filename: Image filenames should not be used as the alt attribute describing the image content. Currently, files uploaded directly to Canvas create a redirect that does not properly verify image filenames. Image alt length: Alt attribute text is recommended to contain fewer than 120 characters. Large text contrast: Text larger than 18pt (or bold 14pt) should display a minimum contrast ratio of 3:1. Lists: Lists should be formatted as lists. Sequential headings: Heading levels should not be skipped (e.g. H2 to H4). However, the tool does not check if the first header starts with H2 or whether the headings are sequential with the rest of the content in the page. Tables do not begin with H1, which is designated for the page title. Small text contrast: Text smaller than 18pt (or bold 14pt) should display a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1. Table captions: Tables should include a caption describing the contents of the table. Table header scope: Table headers should specify scope and the appropriate structure. Table header: Tables should include at least one header.  View Accessibility Checker Notifications If any accessibility issues are detected within the Rich Content Editor, the Accessibility Checker displays an indicator . To view accessibility issues, click the Accessibility Checker icon . View Issues When an issue is detected, the Rich Content Editor highlights the affected area . The sidebar displays the accessibility attribute  and an explanation of the error . To learn more about the accessibility attribute, click the Information icon . View Additional Issues If the Rich Content Editor contains more than one issue , you can view all issues by clicking the Previous or Next buttons . Apply Fix To correct an issue, complete the task as noted in the sidebar . For instance, if the issue requires that alt text be added to an image, the sidebar displays a text field for you to enter alt text. When you are finished with your changes, click the Apply button . The Accessibility Checker will apply the fix and display information for the next issue. Continue to review and fix any detected issues within the editor. Confirm Fix When all issues have been fixed, or if no issues are detected in the Rich Content Editor, the sidebar indicates that no issues exist and will close automatically.",
"How does the Canvas Accessibility Checker find missing alt text, fix low-contrast issues, and make sure there are no accessibility problems?",,"1. Open your content in the Rich Content Editor and click the Accessibility Checker icon (a person with a checkmark).  
2. The editor will scan only content you’ve created in the Rich Content Editor against built-in rules:

   • Low-contrast text (large text must meet 3:1; small text 4.5:1)  
   • Other checks (headings, links, lists, tables, etc.)  
3. When an issue is found, the editor highlights the element and opens a sidebar describing the error.  
4. To fix missing alt text:  
   a. In the sidebar’s Alt Text field, enter a concise description (under 120 characters).  
   b. Click Apply.  
5. To fix low-contrast text:

What is the recommended set up for Canvas for Elementary?
We recommend that every instructor have a dedicated course for their Homeroom. Once a course is designated as a homeroom course, functionality is limited to the items that are needed to manage the content on the dashboard.
We also recommend that instructors have a separate course for every subject that they teach so they display as a subject card on the dashboard for students. This will help the instructor to keep their content and grading organized and will help focus students.
What is the recommended SIS course structure?
We recommend having separate courses for each subject. To create separate courses in Canvas, keep student enrollments current and allow instructors to manage course subject content. Provision data from your SIS to have separate courses or sections sync from your SIS to Canvas for each subject if possible. If you are not able to sync from your SIS, you may be able to create courses manually if allowed by your institution's Canvas admin. If course subjects are created manually, course enrollments must be managed manually as well. However, we are exploring options to help manage enrollments automatically.
