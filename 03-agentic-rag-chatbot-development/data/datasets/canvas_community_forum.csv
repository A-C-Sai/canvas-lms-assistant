"Hey, I'm a bit unsure about a message I sent through Canvas. I'm wondering if it went just to me, or to the whole class. In the ""To:"" field, it only shows my name, and the message is only in my sent folder. I can see an option to add all 60 classmates, but I'm worried I might have accidentally sent a personal reminder to everyone. I thought it was fine initially, but now I'm second-guessing myself. Could someone clarify: if only my name is listed in the ""To:"" field, did only I get the message? Also, if it did go to the entire class, how can I avoid this in the future? Thanks for any help!",You sent it to yourself only. It will only send to everyone if you select the 60 classmates option.
"I am a new student and my course starts tomorrow. It is an online course. I have logged into the student portal with my personal email and it says that I am enrolled in the course, but when I log into canvas with my new TAFE email it says I am not enrolled in any courses. 
It is also a Sunday so I cannot call up for immediate help. 
What do I do given the course is supposed to start tomorrow?","Unfortunately, we won't be able to directly help with your enrollment question.  Every school that uses Canvas as their LMS (Learning Management System) has their own process of enrolling students and instructors into courses.  Many schools have an automated process set up where students enroll in a course via the school's Student Information System (SIS), and that system then sends the enrollment directly into Canvas.  This might be on an established schedule like every two hours, every six hours, twice a day, once a day, etc.  It really depends on the school.  Other schools, depending on their size and student population, might enroll people manually or do things via a self-enrollment process.  Again, it just depends on how your school has chosen to pass enrollments from the SIS into Canvas...and the frequency of sending that data. I'd encourage you to try and reach out to your school's Canvas administrator(s) and someone from their Online Learning / eLearning / Distance Education team to see if they might be able to assist you further. Also, you might want to check your Courses >> All Courses screen within Canvas to see if your courses are listed there.  If you do not see your courses listed there, then you'll want to reach out to folks at your school as I've mentioned above.  If you do see your courses listed there, but they are not currently published, then your instructors have not yet made the content available to you and your classmates.  Once your instructors publish their courses, then you can access the content.  How do I view all my Canvas courses? I hope this information will be of some help to you.  Good luck as you have these conversations with folks at your school!"

Today I was trying to keep up with my work in high school and I realized that they don't show you the work they give this exact day,"It can depend on the teacher and how they organize their page in terms of individual classes, but overall, what I like to do is to switch the dashboard to list view. This way, it displays all your classes assignments for the day in one section, and you can scroll up and down for past assignments and future planned ones."
How do I find my unoffical transcripts in canvas?Where are they?,"Since this question appears to be school-specific, I recommend reaching out directly to your instructor or institution's Canvas admin for assistance."
"During my recent exam, I accidentally clicked on a pop-up notification, and the activity log recorded that I was away from the exam page for about 20–30 seconds. However, after that click, I did not interact with anything outside the exam page. I simply did not click or type within the exam during that short period. May I ask if this kind of inactivity (not interacting on the exam page after clicking an outside notification) is also recorded as being ""out of the exam,"" or does the log only reflect actual navigation away from the page?","Yes, that action would be recorded in the quiz audit logs. Any time a user exists the exam for whatever reason, it will log it in the audit log. However, it will not tell the instructor where you went, just on what question you left the exam on and how long you were off of the exam for. I hope that helps!"
I need the QR code for Canvas,"You can locate the QR code for your Canvas login by clicking the 'Account' button via your Global Navigation menu and clicking QR for mobile login. For more information, feel free to check out this guide: How do I view a QR code to log in to the Canvas mobile apps?"
Unable to play videos due to privacy settings. Please suggest how to fix this,"Without knowing more about the specific videos you're having difficulty with and what browser you're using, it's going to be hard to solve this for sure.  On the browser side, you can look in settings like allowing 3rd party cookies (enable that) or blocking content (disable that).  You could also have browser extensions that are blocking things, so you could try to turn some of those off if you have them. Aside form this info, I'd encourage you to reach out to your school/institution help desk if you continue to have problems and need more help.  They will know more about your specific class and the systems that have in Canvas than we will here in the global Instructure Community. I hope this helps!"
"I am a student, I opened my account to pass my assignment but when I go to my subjects there is already submitted and it's appeared my classmate name, even though she didn't know my account. Also my classmates can see my assignments",Your teacher may have set this assignment up as a group assignment. You should contact the teacher/tutor and let them know.
"I just took a two-hour in-person exam, on paper, and in the middle of the test, my professor comes up to me and asks if I'm cheating. She proceeded to ask if I had my phone on me which I then replied no and took my backpack from under the desk, unzipped it, and rummaged through a pile of study snacks and stationery to retrieve my phone. She then tells me to stay after class which is when she proceeds to say that she noticed an activity on my Canvas. I immediately realized that it was likely because when I put my PC to sleep, it would randomly wake up after X hours. I told her that was likely the case and she found it hard to believe. I have no reason to cheat as it is my senior year in college and I would rather retake the course than commit academic dishonesty. She said that I must write up a report on why there could have been an activity on my Canvas so that she can forward it to the IT at my school. What can I say? Is there any way they could track my IP or the device on which the activity was reported? The only time I accessed Canvas on my phone was one minute before the exam to check my seating assignment but after that, I did not access it again. I'm stressed out here and I still have two other exams to take but I cannot focus because I'm being accused of cheating when I'm not. Will IT understand my circumstances and is there any way to prove my innocence? I just need some type of answer, some form of help.","IT (and some professors) can likely check the user agent of the device accessing it (which tells you the operating system and browser used), so they could know whether it was a phone that accessed it or a laptop. I have used it myself, and caught a student accessing his Canvas exam on his phone (while he left the exam room). Alternatively, both IT and professors can check what you did on the activity history, whether your laptop accessed only the main course page, or if it accessed a specific file. These can be used as proof against you but, if you really did nothing, it can also help exonerate you. I don't know what the IT policy in your school is, whether they are willing to share that information with you before you write the report (to tell the truth, I don't know what my University's policy on that is, either), but you might consider checking?"
I need help or guided to view past grades from a previous course.,The ability to see a Canvas course and any grades in a Canvas course after it has ended is decided based on a mix of instructor and school settings. I would recommend that you either (a) contact your instructor or (b) reach out to your school's Canvas team or IT Department for assistance with this.
whenever I open my canvas it shows a giant unloaded graphic,"In my experience, that sometimes happens if you are not using a compatible version of a supported web browser. What are the browser and computer requirements for Instructure products? - Instructure Community - 6..."
"One of the courses I just completed and am awaiting grades has been completely removed from my Canvas Dashboard.  It is not in previous classes either, and other students are reporting the same problem.  I notified our instructor, who said she would look into it on her end, but suggested we each reach out for support.  But, to whom?","When a course disappears from Canvas for a number of students, it is usually because an instructor has set Course Dates from the course's Settings page and restricted access. It may be that the instructor forgot this, had it set by an admin, or was unaware of the full affect of the settings they chose."
I dont know how to turn in my assignment.,"You could try to follow the How do I submit an online assignment? - Instructure Community - 503 guide to see if the steps listed there work for you.  If those don't work, that likely means the assignment is being turned in somewhere other than Canvas itself, and you'd need to contact your teacher to find out the details if you don't have them already. I hope this helps!"
"Hello, so I was checking out a course that I am taking and I clicked on a quiz and it started. Is there anyway that someone could reset it? Please help! The quiz is due Sunday!",Students are not able to reset their own quiz progress. Please reach out to your instructor for assistance.
idk how to delete a canvas submission as a student HELP ME 😭,"In general, students will not be able to delete submissions from Canvas.  I believe there are a number of reasons for this, including having accurate submission records.  The good news is that you can usually just make another submission, which would somewhat take precedence over the original (but your teacher will see both if they want).  Sometimes teachers or the admin team for Canvas at your school/institution can delete an individual file from a submission if it's absolutely necessary, but you'd need to reach out to them at your school, as the global community of Instructure users which you posted to doesn't have any access to your Canvas account or anything like that. Hope this helps!"
"Hi! I've submitted a jpg photo to be used for my canvas account, but it renders as an empty html image tag. When I try to go to the original file source hosted by canvas everything looks okay, so I'm wondering why it won't display on any other page.","Personally, I don't really associate *.pdf files with images.  Yes, you can insert images into *.pdf files (similar to how you could insert images into MS Word documents), but I don't usually try and upload images via *.pdf documents.  Instead, I would recommend saving your image as a *.jpg, *.png, or *.gif format.  Then, re-try uploading your image to your profile picture in Canvas.  I think you'll have better success with one of those formats instead.  And, in fact, if you take a look at this Guide, How do I add a profile picture in my user account?, you'll see in the light blue box at the top of the page the suggested file formats to use for uploading your image. I hope this will be of some help to you.  Sing out if you have any other questions about this. Take care...be well."
I would like to be able to remove the class cards on the dashboard when not in use? I currently have classes from last semester still up and I just want to clear the dashboard for the new semester. Is there a way to do that or is it something I have to wait on the IT department or professor from previous courses to do unpublished it?,"It is possible, see  How do I customize my Courses list? - Instructure Community - 618759"
"Could you guide me through how to recover my old original submissions? I re-submitted 3 times. Each time I re-submit my new assignment, Canvas automatically delete my old submissions. I want to recover my original assigned submission with my instructor's comments and feedbacks. I contacted my instructor. She said she can still view all my submissions including my original post with her comments. I kindly asked my instructor to help send me back, She referred me here, so I think her answer is no. I would greatly appreciate if someone encounter the same issue.","Unless your school/instructor is using the optional ""Assignment Enhancements"" feature (and it sounds like they are not), student's only have the ability to see their last submission for an assignment. This is different when compared to a quiz, test, or exam.

Based on that you have two options:

Go into the ""Files"" area of your Canvas user account, click on ""Submissions"", and then go into the folder for that specific course. You should be able to see all of your file uploads for every assignment in the course.

Ask your instructor to go into ""SpeedGrader"" for the assignment, find the previous date and time that you submitted, and download t.... They could then email it to you.
I hope that you found this information helpful. Let us know if you need anything else."
