Is it disabled by the institution, the instructor, or my permissions?", "actualOutput": "Let me analyze the information and provide you with a clear answer about Course Analytics visibility in Canvas.\n\nBased on the retrieved information, there are several factors that determine whether Course Analytics is visible to you as a student:\n\n1. **Institutional Permission**: Course Analytics is a feature that must be enabled by your institution. If you cannot view Course Analytics, your institution may have restricted this feature.\n\n2. **Course Permission**: Viewing Analytics is a course-level permission. You need to have the \"Analytics - view pages\" permission to access this feature.\n\n3. **Course Status**: Course Analytics data does not display for:\n   - Unpublished courses\n   - Concluded courses\n   - Inactive courses\n\n4. **Technical Requirements**: For Course Analytics to display properly in Canvas, you may need to enable third-party cookies in your browser settings.\n\n5. **Data Refresh**: The data in Course Analytics is refreshed every 24 hours, so there might be a delay in seeing the most recent activity.\n\nIf you cannot access Course Analytics, the most likely reason is that your institution has restricted this feature.

Can students post group announcements?\nYes, students can make announcements within their groups. This is possible when they are members of a group in Canvas.\n\n2.

Which instructor settings affect group announcements?\nBased on the retrieved information, the main instructor setting that affects group announcements is the ability to enable/disable the \"liking\" feature for announcements. When enabled by instructors:\n- Students can allow other users to like their announcements\n- Users will see a Like icon within announcement replies\n- By default, liking is available to all users in the course\n- Instructors can restrict the liking option to graders only\n\nAdditionally, instructors have control over group creation and can:\n- Create groups for students\n- Allow students to
