Every school that uses Canvas as their LMS (Learning Management System) has their own process of enrolling students and instructors into courses.  Many schools have an automated process set up where students enroll in a course via the school's Student Information System (SIS), and that system then sends the enrollment directly into Canvas.  This might be on an established schedule like every two hours, every six hours, twice a day, once a day, etc.  It really depends on the school.  Other schools, depending on their size and student population, might enroll people manually or do things via a self-enrollment process.  Again, it just depends on how your school has chosen to pass enrollments from the SIS into Canvas...and the frequency of sending that data. I'd encourage you to try and reach out to your school's Canvas administrator(s) and someone from their Online Learning / eLearning / Distance Education team to see if they might be able to assist you further.
