Clicking \"Save Settings\"\n\nIf you need additional technical support with Canvas, you can contact RMIT IT Support:\n- Phone: [+61399258000](tel:+61399258000)\n- Email: [support@rmit.com](mailto:support@rmit.com)\n- Website: [RMIT IT Support](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/it-support-systems/it-service-connect)", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": false, "score": 0.6428571428571429, "reason": "The score is 0.64 because although the response explained how to mark posts read/unread and what the unread icon means, it also included irrelevant meta-statements, generic support info, and contact details.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "o4-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.018751700000000003, "verboseLogs": "Statements:\n[\n    \"The assistant can explain how to mark Canvas Discussion posts as read or unread and what the unread icon indicates.\",\n    \"A blue dot or unread icon indicates that a discussion reply is new or unread.\",\n    \"After you view a discussion reply, the unread icon no longer displays.\",\n    \"By default, Canvas automatically marks posts as read as you scroll down the page.\",\n    \"To mark a single post as unread, click either the \"Mark as Unread\" link below the reply or click the Options icon next to the reply and select \"Mark as Unread\".\",\n    \"To mark a single post as read, click either the \"Mark as Read\" link below the reply or click the Options icon next to the reply and select \"Mark as Read\".\",\n    \"To mark all posts at once, click the discussion topic's Options icon and select either \"Mark All as Read\" or \"Mark All as Unread\".\",\n    \"Once you manually change a post's read or unread state, it will stay in that state until you manually change it again.\",\n    \"You can change your Discussion settings to prevent Canvas from automatically marking posts as read.\",\n    \"To prevent automatic marking, go to Discussions, click the Settings icon, check the \"Manually mark replies as read\" checkbox, and click \"Save Settings\".\",\n    \"For additional technical support with Canvas, you can contact RMIT IT Support by phone, email, or via their website.\",\n    \"The RMIT IT Support phone number is +61399258000.\",\n    \"The RMIT IT Support email address is support@rmit.com.\",\n    \"The RMIT IT Support website is https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/it-support-systems/it-service-connect\"\n] \n \nVerdicts:\n[\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"This is a meta statement about the assistant\\u2019s capability, not an answer to the user\\u2019s question.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Generic technical support information is not relevant to marking discussion posts read/unread.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Contact phone number is irrelevant to the user\\u2019s question about marking posts.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Contact email address is irrelevant to the user\\u2019s question about marking posts.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Support website link is irrelevant to the user\\u2019s question about marking posts.\"\n    }\n]"}], "runDuration": 47.53888424500474, "evaluationCost": 0.018751700000000003, "order": 32}, {"name": "test_case_35", "input": "How do I view and reply to a threaded Canvas LMS announcement as a student?", "actualOutput": "Based on the Canvas guides, I can help you with viewing and replying to threaded announcements.

Instructor settings that affect group announcements:\nBased on the available documentation, there are a few key instructor settings that affect group announcements:\n- Instructors can control whether students can create their own groups (by default, students are allowed to create their own groups as noted in the Course Details tab)\n- Instructors can enable or disable the \"liking\" feature for announcements\n- Instructors can set up group configurations at the course level\n\nIf you need additional assistance with group announcements, you can contact RMIT IT Support:\n- Phone: [+61399258000](tel:+61399258000)\n- Email: [support@rmit.com](mailto:support@rmit.com)\n- Website: [RMIT IT Support](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/it-support-systems/it-service-connect)", "success": false, "metricsData": [{"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": false, "score": 0.6470588235294118, "reason": "The score is 0.65 because the response correctly describes posting and managing group announcements and relevant settings, but it includes irrelevant details about group creation controls and support contact info that aren\u2019t needed to answer the question.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "o4-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.021422500000000004, "verboseLogs": "Statements:\n[\n    \"Students can post announcements within their groups.\",\n    \"Students have the ability to create, edit, and delete announcements within their group.\",\n    \"Students open their group in Canvas to add a group announcement.\",\n    \"Students click the \"Announcements\" link in Group Navigation.\",\n    \"Students click the \"Add Announcement\" button.\",\n    \"Students enter a title in the \"Topic Title\" field.\",\n    \"Students add content using the Rich Content Editor.\",\n    \"Students can allow other users to like the announcement by checking the \"Allow liking\" checkbox if it is enabled by the instructor.\",\n    \"Students click the \"Publish\" button to post the announcement.\",\n    \"Instructors can control whether students can create their own groups.\",\n    \"By default, students are allowed to create their own groups as noted in the Course Details tab.\",\n    \"Instructors can enable or disable the liking feature for announcements.\",\n    \"Instructors can set up group configurations at the course level.\",\n    \"Users can contact RMIT IT Support for additional assistance with group announcements.\",\n    \"Phone: +61399258000.\",\n    \"Email: support@rmit.com.\",\n    \"Website: https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/it-support-systems/it-service-connect\"\n] \n \nVerdicts:\n[\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"This setting controls group creation, not group announcements.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"This describes default group creation permissions, not announcement settings.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"idk\",\n        \"reason\": \"It\\u2019s unclear which group configuration settings specifically affect announcements.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Support contact information is not needed to explain Canvas functionality.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Phone number is not relevant to how to add or configure announcements.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Email address is not relevant to the procedural or settings information requested.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"no\",\n        \"reason\": \"Website link is not relevant to how group announcements are added or configured.\"\n    }\n]"}], "runDuration": 47.47114422699087, "evaluationCost": 0.021422500000000004, "order": 39}, {"name": "test_case_44", "input": "How to use DocViewer to annotate a Canvas assignment submission?", "actualOutput": "Based on the search results, I apologize but I don't see specific information about using DocViewer to annotate Canvas assignment submissions.

Files in Canvas, assign usage rights, and publish them. Here's a comprehensive guide:\n\n1. Uploading Files:\n- You can upload files in two ways:\n  a. Single File Upload:\n     - Navigate to \"Files\" in Course Navigation\n     - Click the \"Upload\" button\n     - Select the file from your computer\n\n  b. Bulk Upload:\n     - For multiple files, you can:\n     - Drag and drop multiple files directly into Canvas\n     - Hold down Shift key to select a group of files, or Control (Windows)/Command (Mac) to select individual files\n     - Note: If uploading more than 50 files, it's recommended to zip them first\n     - Canvas has a file size limit of 5 GB\n\n2. Setting Usage Rights:\n- If copyright and license information is enabled in your course:\n  - You must set usage rights before files can be published\n  - You can set rights for individual files or entire folders\n  - When setting rights for a folder, it applies to all existing files in that folder\n  - Note: New files added to the folder later will need usage rights set separately\n\n3. Publishing Files:\n- Files must have usage rights assigned before they can be published to the course\n- Published course files are viewable by all course users\n- Files are stored in Course Files, which has a default storage space of 500 MB\n- Files uploaded to a course don't count towards personal file quota\n\nAdditional Important Notes:\n- Files and folders are automatically arranged in alphabetical order and cannot be rearranged\n- Instructors can lock folders and files so they're only viewable through direct links or unlock on specific dates\n- Files can be placed in Modules, Assignments, or Pages\n- You can manage course file usage rights requirements through the File Copyright course details setting\n\nIf you need further assistance with Canvas, you can contact RMIT IT
