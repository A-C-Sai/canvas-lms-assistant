Interface and Question Display:\n- Both quiz types can display questions either all at once or one at a time, but the interface and functionality may differ between them\n- The way questions are navigated and displayed can vary between the two versions\n\n3. Quiz Attempts:\n- Both quiz types can allow multiple attempts, but the way attempts are managed and displayed may differ\n- In New Quizzes, you can clearly see the number of attempts you have taken and remaining attempts available\n\n4. Quiz Access:\n- Both quiz types support availability dates and due dates\n- The way these dates are displayed and managed may differ between the two versions\n\nIf you need more specific details about features or functionality differences between New Quizzes and Classic Quizzes, I recommend:\n\n1.

I can help you with managing images in Canvas. Here's a comprehensive answer to your questions:\n\n1. Updating Alt Text/Marking as Decorative:\n- You can manage image alt text through the Image Options menu after embedding an image\n- To access these options:\n  1. Click on the embedded image\n  2. Click the \"Options\" link\n  3. In the Image Options menu, you can:\n     - Manage the image Alt Text\n     - Adjust image size\n     - Configure other display options\n\n2. Choosing Between Embedding vs Text Links:\nFor videos and media content, Canvas provides explicit options:\n- By default, media will display as an embedded item\n- You can choose to display as a text link by:\n  1. Selecting the media\n  2. Clicking \"Video Options\"\n  3. Selecting the \"Display Text Link\" option (this will make the content open in a new tab when clicked)\n\nFor images specifically, you have two main options:\n1. Embedding the image directly into the content (using the Media/Image tool in the Rich Content Editor)\n2.
