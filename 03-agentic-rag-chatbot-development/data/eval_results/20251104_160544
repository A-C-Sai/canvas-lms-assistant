Through Modules:\n- Click the \"Modules\" link in Course Navigation\n- Look for pages within modules (they're marked with a document icon)\n- Click on the page you want to view\n\nIf the Pages link is hidden from your course navigation:\n- Don't worry - you can still access course pages through the Modules page\n- This is a setting controlled by your instructor\n- You'll need to use the Modules method described above to access pages\n\nIf you're having trouble accessing your course content and these methods don't work, you should contact RMIT IT Support:\n- Phone: [+61399258000](tel:+61399258000)\n- Email: [support@rmit.com](mailto:support@rmit.com)\n- Website: [RMIT IT Support](https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/it-support-systems/it-service-connect)", "success": true, "metricsData": [{"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "The score is 1.00 because the response directly addresses viewing Canvas Pages and handling a hidden Pages link with no irrelevant content.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "o4-mini", "evaluationCost": 0.0138193, "verboseLogs": "Statements:\n[\n    \"I can help you understand how to view Canvas Pages and what to do if the Pages link is hidden.\",\n    \"There are two main ways to view Pages in Canvas.\",\n    \"Click the \"Pages\" link in Course Navigation.\",\n    \"If there's a front page, you'll see it first.\",\n    \"Click the \"View All Pages\" button to see the Pages index.\",\n    \"The Pages index will show all pages in the course.\",\n    \"Click on any page title to view it.\",\n    \"Click the \"Modules\" link in Course Navigation.\",\n    \"Look for pages within modules (they're marked with a document icon).\",\n    \"Click on the page you want to view.\",\n    \"You can still access course pages through the Modules page if the Pages link is hidden.\",\n    \"The visibility of the Pages link is controlled by your instructor.\",\n    \"You need to use the Modules method to access pages when the Pages link is hidden.\",\n    \"Contact RMIT IT Support if you can't access course content using these methods.\",\n    \"RMIT IT Support phone number is +61399258000.\",\n    \"RMIT IT Support email is support@rmit.com.\",\n    \"RMIT IT Support website is https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/support-services/it-support-systems/it-service-connect.\"\n] \n \nVerdicts:\n[\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    },\n    {\n        \"verdict\": \"yes\",\n        \"reason\": null\n    }\n]"}], "runDuration": 39.59793329500826, "evaluationCost": 0.0138193, "order": 0}, {"name": "test_case_15", "input": "How do I submit a URL in Canvas when using Assignment Enhancements, and what should I do if the URL option is missing?", "actualOutput": "Based on the information retrieved, I can help you with submitting a URL in Canvas with Assignment Enhancements and what to do if the URL option is missing.

Will it override changes, trigger warnings, affect my storage quota, or alter dates and external tool settings?", "actualOutput": "Let me analyze the retrieved information and provide you with a comprehensive answer about how re-importing a Canvas course affects existing content.\n\nBased on the information from Canvas guides, here's how re-importing a course affects various aspects:\n\n1. **Existing Content and Changes:**\n- When importing content, Canvas will display a warning message explaining that previously imported content from the same course will be replaced, while manually added content will remain.\n\n2. **Storage Quota Impact:**\n- Importing courses and course files counts against your course file quotas\n- However, if you're copying existing Canvas courses and course files, they will reference the original Canvas course file quota and won't count against your new course file quotas\n\n3. **External Tool Settings:**\n- If you import LTI (external tool) content from a course, the external tools may need to be reconfigured in the receiving course for that content to be accessible\n\n4. **Content Organization:**\n- Imported assignments are placed in an assignment group called \"Imported Assignments\" (though they can be moved to other assignment groups as needed)\n- Some content is not included in course imports:\n  - Enrollment-related data (course users, collaborations, conferences, groups, and sections)\n  - Feature option settings\n  - Calendar item locations (e.g., office hours slots with assigned locations)\n\n5. **Important Notes about Specific Content:**\n- Announcements and Discussions won't retain the original creator's name\n- Students won't receive notifications for imported announcements (though they will see badges indicating new announcements on the Dashboard)\n- Assignments with manual grade posting policies and anonymous settings will retain these settings during import\n- To prevent zero grades from being automatically entered in the Gradebook when importing content into a course with a late/missing policy, it's recommended to temporarily disable the late/missing policy before importing and re-enable it after the import is complete\n\nIf you need additional assistance with course imports or encounter any issues, please contact RMIT IT Support:\n- Phone: [+61399258000](tel:+61399258000)\n- Email:
