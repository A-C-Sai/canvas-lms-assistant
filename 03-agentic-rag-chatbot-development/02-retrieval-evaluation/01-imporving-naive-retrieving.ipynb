Sometimes teachers or the admin team for Canvas at your school/institution can delete an individual file from a submission if it's absolutely necessary, but you'd need to reach out to them at your school, as the global community of Instructure users which you posted to doesn't have any access to your Canvas account or anything like that.

Every school that uses Canvas as their LMS (Learning Management System) has their own process of enrolling students and instructors into courses.  Many schools have an automated process set up where students enroll in a course via the school's Student Information System (SIS), and that system then sends the enrollment directly into Canvas.  This might be on an established schedule like every two hours, every six hours, twice a day, once a day, etc.  It really depends on the school.  Other schools, depending on their size and student population, might enroll people manually or do things via a self-enrollment process.  Again, it just depends on how your school has chosen to pass enrollments from the SIS into Canvas...and the frequency of sending that data. I'd encourage you to try and reach out to your school's Canvas administrator(s) and someone from their Online Learning / eLearning / Distance Education team to see if they might be able to assist you further. Also, you might want to check your Courses >> All Courses screen within Canvas to see if your courses are listed there.  If you do not see your courses listed there, then you'll want to reach out to folks at your school as I've mentioned above.  If you do see your courses listed there, but they are not currently published, then your instructors have not yet made the content available to you and your classmates.  Once your instructors publish their courses, then you can access the content.  How do I view all my Canvas courses? I hope this information will be of some help to you.

Every school that uses Canvas as their LMS (Learning Management System) has their own process of enrolling students and instructors into courses.  Many schools have an automated process set up where students enroll in a course via the school's Student Information System (SIS), and that system then sends the enrollment directly into Canvas.  This might be on an established schedule like every two hours, every six hours, twice a day, once a day, etc.  It really depends on the school.  Other schools, depending on their size and student population, might enroll people manually or do things via a self-enrollment process.  Again, it just depends on how your school has chosen to pass enrollments from the SIS into Canvas...and the frequency of sending that data. I'd encourage you to try and reach out to your school's Canvas administrator(s) and someone from their Online Learning / eLearning / Distance Education team to see if they might be able to assist you further. Also, you might want to check your Courses >> All Courses screen within Canvas to see if your courses are listed there.  If you do not see your courses listed there, then you'll want to reach out to folks at your school as I've mentioned above.  If you do see your courses listed there, but they are not currently published, then your instructors have not yet made the content available to you and your classmates.
