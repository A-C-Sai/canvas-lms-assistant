# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

This directory contains the initial implementation and testing of the Canvas Assistant chatbot's MVP version.

## Overview

The MVP implementation provides a basic but functional version of the chatbot with core features for testing and validation.
It includes streaming, real-time responses from the LLM and a naive retrieval pipeline (vector search over the Chroma knowledge base) used to fetch candidate documents for generation and testing.
