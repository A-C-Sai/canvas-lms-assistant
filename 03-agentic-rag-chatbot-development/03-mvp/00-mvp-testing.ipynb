      "1. Helping students with Canvas-related technical issues\n",
      "2. Providing guidance on Canvas features and functionalities\n",

      "🤖 Assistant: \u001b[32mLet me search for information about groups in Canvas.\u001b[0m\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 Assistant: \u001b[32mBased on the information from Canvas guides, let me explain what groups are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Groups in Canvas are a collaborative tool that functions like a smaller version of a course. Here are the key points about groups:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Basic Purpose:\n",
      "- Groups require a minimum of two students to work together\n",
      "- They're designed for collaboration on group projects and assignments\n",
      "\n",
      "2. As a student, within groups you can:\n",
      "- View groups you're enrolled in\n",
      "- Join or create student groups (if allowed)\n",
      "- Store and share files\n",
      "- Start discussions\n",
      "- Send messages\n",
      "- Create group collaborations\n",
      "- Work on group assignments (where one member can submit on behalf of the group)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Common Uses for Students:\n",
      "- Creating study groups\n",
      "- Collaborating on projects and assignments\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Group Access:\n",
      "- Your instructor may assign you to a course group\n",
      "- Other students may include you as a member in a student group\n",
      "- Depending on settings, you may be able to create, join, switch, or leave groups\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Group Navigation:\n",
      "- Gives you access to group activities and files\n",
      "- Includes features like group announcements, pages, discussions, files, conferences, and collaborations\n",
      "\n",
      "This information comes from Canvas's official guides <doc1> and <doc2>. If you need more specific information about how to use any of these group features, please feel free to ask!\u001b[0m\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "🙋🏻‍♂️ You: \u001b[31mcan i view doc 1 and 2 to verify\u001b[0m\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 Assistant: \u001b[32mI apologize, but I cannot provide direct access to the source documents. However, I can provide you with the official Canvas Community links where this information is publicly available:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"What are Groups?\":\n",
      "https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/What-are-Groups/ta-p/16\n",
      "\n",
      "2. \"How do I use groups as a student?\":\n",

      "\n",
      "You can visit these links to verify the information I provided. Is there anything specific about groups that you'd like me to clarify?\u001b[0m\n",

      "🙋🏻‍♂️ You: \u001b[31mI want to see the docs AS IS\u001b[0m\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 Assistant: \u001b[32mI apologize, but I am not able to share the raw documents directly with you. As an AI Support Chatbot, I use these documents internally to provide accurate information, but I cannot display the full raw content of the Canvas guides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, I encourage you to:\n",
      "1. Visit the official Canvas Community links I provided above to read the documentation directly\n",
      "2. Ask me specific questions about groups, and I'll help you with accurate information from the guides\n",
