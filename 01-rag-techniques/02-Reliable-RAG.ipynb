Note: If the Discussions link is not available in Course Navigation, you can access course discussions through the Modules page. View Discussions Discussions are organized into three main areas. Discussions : These are current discussions within the course. Discussions are ordered by most recent activity. This section heading only displays if there are discussions within this section. Pinned Discussions : These are discussions that your instructor wants you to pay specific attention to and appear at the top of the Discussions page. This section heading only displays if there are discussions within this section as designated by your instructor. Closed for Comments : These discussions have been manually closed for comments, or the discussion is past the available from/until date. These are discussions that are only available in a read-only state and are ordered by most recent activity. This section section heading displays even if there are no discussions within this section. View Individual Discussion Each discussion displays whether or not it is a graded discussion , the name of the discussion , the date on which the last discussion reply was posted , the due date (if any) , the number of unread/total posts in the discussion , and whether or not you are subscribed to the discussion . You can also view availability dates for individual discussions . An unread icon next to a discussion indicates an unread discussion . The number of unread/total posts will not appear for group discussions and discussions that have no discussion replies . There will also be a peer review icon if a graded\\xa0discussion has been assigned peer reviews [10]. View Availability Dates The first dates you may see are the availability dates. Your instructor may use availability dates to restrict discussion replies to a specified date range. The availability dates are the range of time that the discussion is accessible to you. Availability dates also appear on the Assignments page for all discussions with assigned availability dates. If the discussion does not have a date listed, the discussion is open; you can reply to the discussion at any time during your course . If the discussion says Not Available Until [date], the discussion is locked until the specified date . If the discussion says Available until [date], you can reply to the discussion until the specified date . If the discussion is in the Closed for Comments section, the discussion cannot accept submissions . Discussions in this section may show a \"Was locked at [date]\" to indicate when the discussion was closed for comments . Note: If the listed date is set to 12 a.m. the last day for the assignment to be submitted is the full day before the listed date. For instance, if an assignment is Available until December 15, you can access the assignment until December 14 at 11:59 p.m. View Due Dates The second set of dates are the due dates for each respective discussion . However, due dates only apply to graded discussions . Any replies to discussions after the due date are marked as late; some instructors may deduct points for late replies. You can still reply to late discussion before the Available until date. Due dates also include a time . If your instructor does not set a due time, the listed date displays the course\\'s default due time. Note: The Due date may be before or on the Available date. Filter Discussions There are a few ways to filter Discussions: View All or only unread discussions by selecting an option from the drop-down menu. Search for a discussion by typing a discussion title, a user name, or a keyword in the Search field. Start a new discussion by clicking the Add Discussion button.

      "How do I attach a file to a discussion reply as a student? If your instructor allows file attachments, you can attach a file to a discussion reply using the attachment icon. Attachments can be added to both graded and non-graded discussions. Any attachments added as part of discussions are copied to your user files . Attachments for graded discussions are not counted against your user quota and cannot be deleted. Files uploaded using the Rich Content Editor count toward your user storage quota. Notes: If the attachment icon does not display, this option is not available in your course. If your attachment causes you to exceed your user file quota, the file may fail to attach to an ungraded discussion. If you have permission to edit or delete discussion replies , editing a reply also allows you to remove an attachment. \n",
